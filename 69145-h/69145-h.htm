<p class="drop-cap">DIANA ROYALL pushed back the music-rack
and rose from her seat at the piano.</p>

<p>“Show the person in here, Kingdom.”</p>

<p>The negro disappeared, and Diana moved slowly
to the table at the farther end of the long room, and
stood there turning over some papers in her leisurely,
graceful way.</p>

<p>“Who in the world is it now?” Mrs. Eaton asked,
looking up from her solitaire, “a book agent?”</p>

<p>“Caleb Trench,” Diana replied carelessly, “the
shopkeeper at Eshcol.”</p>

<p>“The storekeeper?” Mrs. Eaton looked as if
Diana had said the chimney-sweep. “What in the
world does he want of you, my dear?”</p>

<p>Diana laughed. “How should I know?” she retorted,
with a slight scornful elevation of her brows;
“we always pay cash there.”</p>

<p>“I wonder that you receive him in the drawing-room,”
Mrs. Eaton remonstrated, shuffling her cards
with delicate, much be-ringed fingers, and that indefinable
manner which lingers with some old ladies,
like their fine old lace and their ancestors, and is at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
once a definition and classification. Thus, one could
see, at a glance, that Mrs. Eaton had been a belle
before the war, for, as we all know, the atmosphere
of belledom is as difficult to dissipate and forget as
the poignant aroma of a moth-ball in an old fur coat,
though neither of them may have served the purposes
of preservation.</p>

<p>The girl made no reply, and the older woman was
instinctively aware of her indifference to her opinions,
uttered or unexpressed. There were times when
Diana’s absorption of mood, her frank inattention,
affected her worldly mentor as sharply as a slap in
the face, yet, the next moment, she fell easily under
the spell of her personality. Mrs. Eaton always felt
that no one could look at her youthful relative without
feeling that her soul must be as beautiful as her
body, though she herself had never been able to
form any estimate of that soul. Diana hid it with a
reserve and a mental strength which folded it away
as carefully as the calyx of a cactus guards the delicate
bloom with its thorns. But the fact that Mrs.
Eaton overlooked was still more apparent, the fact
that a great many people never thought of Diana’s
soul at all, being quite content to admire the long
and exquisite curves of her tall figure, the poise of
her graceful head, with the upward wave of its bright
hair, and the level glance of her dear eyes under their
thick dark lashes. There was something fine about
her vitality, her freshness, the perfection of her dress
and her bearing, which seemed so harmoniously accentuated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
by the subdued elegance of the charming
old room. Nature had specialized her by the divine
touch of a beauty that apparently proclaimed the
possession of an equally beautiful spirit; not even
the flesh and blood surface seemed always impenetrable,
but rather delicately transparent to every
spiritual variation, like the crystal sphere of the
magician. But Mrs. Eaton, pondering on her young
cousin’s personality from a more frivolous standpoint,
took alarm most readily at her independence,
and was overcome now with the impropriety of receiving
a village shopkeeper in the drawing-room
after dinner.</p>

<p>“My dear,” she remonstrated again, “hadn’t you
better speak to him in the hall?”</p>

<p>Diana looked up from her paper, slightly bored.
“In that case, Cousin Jinny, you couldn’t hear what
he said,” she remarked composedly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eaton reddened and put a three spot on her
ace instead of a two. “I do not care to—” she
began and paused, her utterance abruptly suspended
by the shock of a new perception.</p>

<p>For, at that moment, Kingdom-Come announced
Diana’s unbidden guest and Mrs. Eaton forgot what
she was going to say, forgot her manners in fact, and
gazed frankly at the big man who came slowly and
awkwardly into the room. His appearance, indeed,
had quite a singular effect upon her. She wondered
vaguely if she could be impressed, or if it was only
the result of the unexpected contact with the lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
class? She was fond of speaking of the Third Estate;
she had found the expression somewhere during her
historical peckings, and appropriated it at once as
a comprehensive phrase with an aristocratic flavor,
though its true meaning proved a little elusive.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the unwelcome visitor was confronting
Miss Royall and there was a moment of audible
silence. Diana met his glance more fully than she
had ever been aware of doing before, in her brief
visits to his shop, and, like her elderly cousin, she
received a new and vital impression, chiefly from the
depth and lucidity of his gaze, which seemed to
possess both composure and penetration; she felt
her cheeks flush hotly, yet was conscious that his look
was neither familiar nor offending, but was rather
the glance of a personality as strong as her own.</p>

<p>“You wish to speak to me?” she said impatiently,
forgetting the fine courtesy that she usually showed
to an inferior.</p>

<p>As she spoke, her father and Jacob Eaton came
in from the dining-room and, pausing within the
wide low doorway, were silent spectators of the
scene.</p>

<p>“I wished to see you, yes,” said Trench quietly,
advancing to the table and deliberately putting some
pennies on it. “When you bought that piece of muslin
this morning I gave you the wrong change. After
you left the shop I found I owed you six cents. I
walked over with it this evening as soon as I closed
the doors. I would have left it with your servant at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
the door, but he insisted that I must see you in person.”
He added this gravely, deliberately allowing
her to perceive that he understood his reception.</p>

<p>Diana bit her lip to suppress a smile, and was conscious
that Jacob Eaton was openly hilarious. She
was half angry, too, because Trench had put her in
the wrong by recognizing her discourtesy and treating
it courteously. Beyond the circle of the lamplight
was the critical audience of her home-life, her
father’s stately figure and white head, Mrs. Eaton’s
elderly elegance, and Jacob’s worldly wisdom. She
looked at Trench with growing coldness.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said, “shall I give you a receipt?”</p>

<p>He met her eye an instant, and she saw that he was
fully cognizant of her sarcasm. “As you please,”
he replied unmoved.</p>

<p>She felt herself rebuked again, and her anger
kindled unreasonably against the man who was
smarting under her treatment. She went to the
table, and taking a sheet of folded note-paper wrote a
receipt and signed it, handing it to him with a slight
haughty inclination of the head which was at once
an acknowledgment and a dismissal.</p>

<p>But again he met her with composure. He took
the paper, folded it twice and put it in his pocketbook,
then he bade her good evening and, passing Eaton
with scarcely a glance, bowed to Colonel Royall and
went out, his awkward figure in its rough tweed suit
having made a singular effect in the old-fashioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
elegance of Colonel Royall’s house, an effect that
fretted Diana’s pride, for it had seemed to her that,
as he passed, he had overshadowed her own father
and dwarfed Jacob Eaton. Yet, at the time, she
thought of none of these things. She pushed the
offending pennies across the table.</p>

<p>“Cousin Jinny,” she said carelessly, “there are
some Peter pence for your dago beggars.”</p>

<p>Cousin Jinny gathered up the pennies and dropped
them thoughtfully into the little gold-linked purse on
her chatelaine. For years she had been contributing
a yearly subsidy to the ever increasing family of a
former gondolier, the unforgotten grace of whose
slender legs had haunted her memory for twenty
years, during which period she had been the recipient
of annual announcements of twins and triplets, whose
arrivals invariably punctuated peculiarly unremunerative
years.</p>

<p>“That man,” she said, referring to Trench and not
the gondolier, “that man is an anarchist.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Eaton had a settled conviction that all undesirable
persons were anarchists. To her nebulous
vision innumerable immigrant ships were continually
unloading anarchists in bulk, as merchantmen might
unship consignments of Sea Island cotton or Jamaica
rum; and every fresh appearance of the social unwashed
was to her an advent of an atom from these
incendiary cargoes.</p>

<p>“I hope you were careful about your receipt,
Diana,” said Jacob Eaton, stopping to light a cigarette<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
at the tall candelabrum on the piano. “How
far did your admirer walk to bring that consignment
of pennies?”</p>

<p>“My admirer?” Diana shot a scornful glance at
him. “I call it an intrusion.”</p>

<p>“Did he walk over from that little shop at Cross-Roads?”
Mrs. Eaton asked. “I seem to remember
a shop there.”</p>

<p>“It’s seven miles,” said Colonel Royall, speaking
for the first time, “and the roads are bad. I think he
is merely scrupulously honest, Diana,” he added; “I
was watching his face.”</p>

<p>Diana flushed under her father’s eye. “I suppose
he is,” she said reluctantly, “but, pshaw—six cents!
He could have handed it to a servant.”</p>

<p>“Do you send the servants there?” Colonel Royall
asked pointedly.</p>

<p>“No,” she admitted reluctantly, “I suppose he
rarely sees any one from here, but there was Kingdom
at the door.”</p>

<p>“Who insisted on his seeing you, you remember,”
objected her father; “the soul of Kingdom-Come is
above six pennies.”</p>

<p>“Well, so is mine!” exclaimed Diana pettishly.</p>

<p>“Seven miles in red clay mud to see you,” mocked
Jacob Eaton, smiling at her.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” she retorted.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you take that tone, Jacob,”
warned his mother a little nervously. “I call it bad
taste; he couldn’t presume to—to—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>“To walk seven miles?” her son laughed “My
dear lady, I’d walk seventeen to see Diana.”</p>

<p>“My dear courtier, throw down your cloak in the
mud and let me walk upon it,” retorted Diana
scornfully.</p>

<p>“I have thrown down, instead, my heart,” he replied
in a swift undertone.</p>

<p>But Diana was watching her father and apparently
did not hear him. Colonel Royall had moved to his
usual big chair by the hearth. A few logs were kindling
there, for, though it was early in April, it was a
raw chill evening. The firelight played on the noble
and gentle lines of the colonel’s old face, on his white
hair and moustache and in the mild sweetness of his
absent-minded eyes. His daughter, looking at him
fondly, thought him peculiarly sad, and wondered if it
was because they were approaching an anniversary in
that brief sad married life which seemed to have left a
scar too deep for even her tender touch.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind about the amount—six cents may
be as sacred to him as six dollars,” he was saying.
“The man has a primitive face, the lines are quite remarkable,
and—” he leaned back and looked over at
the young man by the piano—“Jacob, I’ve heard of
this Caleb Trench three times this week in politics.”</p>

<p>“A village orator?” mocked Eaton, without dropping
his air of nonchalant superiority, an air that
nettled Colonel Royall as much as a heat-rash.</p>

<p>He shook his head impatiently. “Ask Mahan,” he
said. “I don’t know, but twice I’ve been told that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
Caleb Trench could answer this or that, and yesterday—”
he leaned back, shading his eyes with his
hand as he looked into the fire—“yesterday—what
was it? Oh—” he stopped abruptly, and a delicate
color, almost a woman’s blush, went up to his hair.</p>

<p>“And yesterday?” asked Eaton, suddenly alert,
his mocking tone lost, the latent shrewdness revealing
itself through the thin mask of his commonplace
good looks.</p>

<p>“Well, I heard that he was opposed to Aylett’s
methods,” Colonel Royall said, with evident reluctance,
“and that he favored Yarnall.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Eaton started violently and dropped her pack
of cards, and Diana and she began to gather them up
again, Cousin Jinny’s fingers trembling so much that
the girl had to find them all.</p>

<p>Jacob stood listening, his eyelids drooping over his
eyes and his upper lip twitching a little at the corners
like a dog who is puckering his lip to show his fangs.
“Yarnall is a candidate for governor,” he said coolly.</p>

<p>Colonel Royall frowned slightly. “I’d rather keep
Aylett,” he rejoined.</p>

<p>“Yarnall had no strength a week ago, but to-day
the back counties are supporting him,” said Eaton,
“why, heaven knows! Some one must be organizing
them, but who?”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall drummed on the arm of his chair
with his fingers. “Since the war there’s been an upheaval,”
he said thoughtfully. “It was like a whirlpool,
stirred the mud up from the bottom, and we’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
getting it now. No one can predict anything; it isn’t
the day for an old-fashioned gentleman in politics.”</p>

<p>“Which is an admission that shopkeepers ought to
be in them,” suggested Jacob, without emotion.</p>

<p>Colonel Royall laughed. “Maybe it is,” he admitted,
“anyway I’m not proud of my own party
out here. I’m willing to stand by my colors, but I’m
usually heartily ashamed of the color bearer. It’s
not so much the color of one’s political coat as the
lining of one’s political pockets. I wish I had Abe
Lincoln’s simple faith. What we need now is a man
who isn’t afraid to speak the truth; he’d loom up
like Saul among the prophets.”</p>

<p>“Again let me suggest the shopkeeper at the Cross-Roads,”
said Jacob Eaton.</p>

<p>Colonel Royall smiled sadly. “Why not?” he
said. “Lincoln was a barefoot boy. Why not Caleb
Trench? Since he’s honest over little things, he
might be over great things.”</p>

<p>“Is he a Democrat?” Jacob asked suavely.</p>

<p>“On my word, I don’t know,” replied Colonel
Royall. “He’s in Judge Hollis’ office reading law,
so William Cheyney told me.”</p>

<p>“That old busybody!” Jacob struck the ashes
from his cigarette viciously.</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Diana, “treason! Don’t you say a
word against Dr. Cheyney. I’ve loved him these
many years.”</p>

<p>“A safe sentiment,” said Jacob. “I’m content to
be his rival. Alas, if he were the only one!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“What did you say Caleb Trench was doing in the
judge’s office, pa?” Diana asked, ignoring her cousin.</p>

<p>“Reading law, my dear,” the colonel answered.</p>

<p>“I thought he was a poor shopkeeper,” objected
Mrs. Eaton.</p>

<p>“So he is, Jinny,” said the colonel; “but he’s
reading law at night. It’s all mightily to his credit.”</p>

<p>“He’s altogether too clever, then,” said Mrs. Eaton
firmly; “it is just as I said, he’s an anarchist!”</p>

<p>“Dear me, let’s talk of some one else,” Diana protested.
“The man must have hoodooed us; we’ve
discussed nothing else since he left.”</p>

<p>“Though lost to sight, to memory dear,” laughed
Jacob, throwing back his sleek dark head, and blowing
his cigarette smoke into rings before his face: he
was still leaning against the piano, and his attitude
displayed his well-knit, rather slight figure. His
mother, gazing at him with an admiration not unlike
the devotion the heathen extends to his favorite deity,
regarded him as a supreme expression of the best in
manhood and wisdom. To her Jacob was little short
of a divinity and nothing short of a tyrant, under
whose despotic rule she had trembled since he was
first able to express himself in the cryptic language of
the cradle, which had meant with him an unqualified
and unrestrained shriek for everything he wanted.
She thought he showed to peculiar advantage, too,
in the setting of the old room with its two centers of
light, the lamp on the table and the fire on the hearth,
with the well-worn Turkey rugs, its darkly polished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
floor, the rare pieces of Chippendale, and the equally
rare old paintings on the walls. There was a fine,
richly toned portrait of Colonel Royall’s grandfather,
who had been with Washington at Yorktown, and
there was a Corot and a Van Dyke, originals that had
cost the colonel’s father a small fortune in his time.
Best of all, perhaps, was the Greuze, for there was
something in the shadowy beauty of the head which
suggested Diana.</p>

<p>Colonel Royall himself had apparently forgotten
Jacob and his attitude. The old man was gazing
absently into the fire, and the latent tenderness in
his expression, the fine droop of eyes and lips seemed
to suggest some deeper current of thought which the
light talk stirred and brought to the surface. There
was a reminiscent sadness in his glance which ignored
the present and warned his daughter of the shoals.
She leaned forward and held her hands out to the
blaze.</p>

<p>“If it’s fine next week, I’m going up to Angel
Pass to see if the anemones are not all in bloom,”
she said abruptly.</p>

<p>Colonel Royall rose, and walking to the window,
drew aside the heavy curtains and looked out. “The
night is superb,” he said. “Come here, Di, and see
Orion’s golden sword. If it is like this, we will go
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>But Diana, going to him, laid a gentle hand on his
arm. “To-morrow was mother’s birthday, pa,” she
said softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>Mrs. Eaton looked up and caught her son’s eye,
and turned her face carefully from the two in the bay
window. “Think of it,” she murmured, with a look
of horrified disapproval, “think of keeping Letty’s
birthday here!”</p>

<p>But Jacob, glancing at Diana’s unconscious back,
signed to her to be silent.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was the end of another day when Caleb
Trench and his dog, Shot, came slowly down
the long white road from Paradise Ridge. It
is a shell road, exceeding white and hard, and below
it, at flood-tide, the river meadows lie half submerged;
it turns the corner below the old mill and
passes directly through the center of Eshcol to the
city. Behind the mill, the feathery green of spring
clouded the low hills in a mist of buds and leafage.
The slender stem of a silver birch showed
keen against a group of red cedars. A giant pine
thrust its height above its fellows, its top stripped
by lightning and hung with a squirrel’s nest.</p>

<p>Trench and his dog, a rough yellow outcast that
he had adopted, were approaching the outskirts of
Eshcol. Here and there was a farmhouse, but the
wayside was lonely, and he heard only the crows in
the tree-tops. It was past five o’clock and the air was
sweet. He smelt the freshly turned earth in the fields
where the robins were hunting for grubs. Beyond the
river the woods were drifted white with wild cucumber.
Yonder, in the corner of a gray old fence,
huddled some of Aaron Todd’s sheep. The keen
atmosphere was mellowing at the far horizon to molten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
gold; across it a drifting flight of swallows was sharply
etched, an eddying maelstrom of graceful wings.</p>

<p>In the middle of the road Caleb Trench was suddenly
aware of a small figure, which might have been
three years old, chubby and apparently sexless, for it
was clad in a girl’s petticoats and a boy’s jacket, its
face round and smeared with jelly.</p>

<p>“Sammy,” said Trench kindly, “how did you get
here?”</p>

<p>“Penny,” said Sammy, “wants penny!”</p>

<p>To Sammy the tall man with the homely face and
clear gray eyes was a mine of pennies and consequently
of illicit candy; the soul of Sammy was greedy as well
as his stomach. Trench thrust his hand into his pocket
and produced five pennies. Sammy’s dirty little fist
closed on them with the grip of the nascent financier.</p>

<p>“Sammy tired,” he sobbed, “wants go to candy
man’s!”</p>

<p>Trench stooped good-naturedly and lifted the
bundle of indescribable garments; he had carried it
before, and the candy man was only a quarter of a
mile away. He was raising the child to his shoulder
when the growth of pokeberry bushes at the roadside
shook and a woman darted out from behind it. She
was scarcely more than a girl and pitifully thin and
wan. Her garments, too, were sexless; she wore a
girl’s short skirt and a man’s waistcoat; a man’s soft
felt hat rested on a tangled mass of hair,—the coarse
and abundant hair of peasant ancestry. She ran up
to him and snatched the child out of his arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“You shan’t have him!” she cried passionately;
“you shan’t touch him—he’s mine!”</p>

<p>Sammy screamed dismally, clutching his pennies.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Jean,” said Trench quietly. “I
know he’s yours.”</p>

<p>“He’s mine!” She was stamping her foot in
passion, her thin face crimson, the veins standing
out on her forehead. “He’s mine—you may try
ter get him, but you won’t—you won’t—you
won’t!” she screamed.</p>

<p>The child was frightened now, and clasped both
arms around her neck, screaming too.</p>

<p>“I was only offering to carry him to the candy
man’s, Jean,” Trench said; “don’t get so excited.
I know the child is yours.”</p>

<p>“He’s mine!” she cried again, “mine! That’s
my shame, they call it, and preach at me, and try
ter take him away. They want ’er steal him, but
they shan’t; they shan’t touch him any more’n you
shall! He’s mine; God gave him ter me, and I’ll
keep him. You can kill me, but you shan’t have
him noways!” She was quivering from head to
foot, her wild eyes flashing, her face white now with
the frenzy that swept away every other thought.</p>

<p>“Hush,” said Trench sternly, “no one wants to
steal the child, Jean; it’s only your fancy. Be
quiet.”</p>

<p>He spoke with such force that the girl fell back,
leaning against the fence, holding the sobbing child
tight, her eyes devouring the man’s strong, clean-featured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
face. Her clouded mind was searching for
memories. She had lost her wits when Sammy was
born without a father to claim him. Trench still
stood in the middle of the road, and his figure was at
once striking and homely. He was above the average
height, big-boned and lean, the fineness of his head
and the power of his face not less notable because of
a certain awkwardness that, at first, disguised the
real power of the man, a power so vital that it grew
upon you until his personality seemed to stand out
in high relief against the commonplace level of humanity.
He had the force and vitality of a primitive man.</p>

<p>The girl crouched against the fence, and the two
looked at each other. Suddenly she put the child
down and, coming cautiously nearer, pointed with
one hand, the other clenched against her flat chest.</p>

<p>“I know you,” she whispered, in a strange penetrating
voice, “I know you at last—<i>you’re him</i>.”</p>

<p>Trench regarded her a moment in speechless amazement,
then the full significance of her words was
borne in upon him by the wild rage in her eyes. He
knew she was half crazed and saw his peril if this
belief became fixed in her mind. Often as he had seen
her she had never suggested such a delusion as was
then taking root in her demented brain.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” he said gently, slowly, persuasively,
trying to impress her, as he might a child;
“you have forgotten; I only came to Eshcol four
years ago. You have not known me two years, Jean;
you are thinking of some one else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>A look of cunning succeeded the fury in her eyes,
as she peered at him. “It’s like you ter say it,” she
cried triumphantly at last, “it’s like you ter hide.
You’re afeard, you were always afeard—coward,
coward!”</p>

<p>Trench laid his powerful hand on her shoulder
and almost shook her. “Be still,” he said authoritatively,
“it is false. You know it’s false. I am
not he.”</p>

<p>She wrenched away from him, laughing and crying
together. “’Tis him,” she repeated; “I know him
by this!” and she suddenly snatched at the plain
signet ring that he wore on his left hand.</p>

<p>Trench drew his hand away in anger, his patience
exhausted. “Jean,” he said harshly, “you’re mad.”</p>

<p>“No!” she shook her head, still pointing at him,
“no—it is you!”</p>

<p>She was pointing, her wild young face rigid, as a
carriage came toward them. Trench looked up and
met the calm gaze of Colonel Royall and Diana,
who occupied the back seat. In front, beside the
negro coachman, Jacob Eaton leaned forward and
stared rudely at the group in the dust.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Jacob?” the old man asked,
as the carriage passed.</p>

<p>The young one laughed. “The old story, I reckon,
Colonel,” he said affably, “begging Diana’s pardon.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t beg my pardon. It was Jean Bartlett,
pa,” she added, blushing suddenly.</p>

<p>“Poor girl!” The colonel touched his lips thoughtfully.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
“By gad, I wish I knew who was the father
of her child—I’d make him keep her from starving.”</p>

<p>“You do that, pa,” said Diana quietly.</p>

<p>“I reckon the father’s there now,” said Jacob
Eaton, with a slight sneer.</p>

<p>Diana flashed a look at the back of his head which
ought to have scorched it. “It is only the shopkeeper
at Eshcol,” she said haughtily.</p>

<p>“Are shopkeepers immune, Diana?” asked Jacob
Eaton, chuckling.</p>

<p>“I am immune from such conversations,” replied
Diana superbly.</p>

<p>Jacob apologized.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the group by the wayside had drawn
nearer together. “I will take your child home, for
you are tired,” said Trench sternly, “but I tell you
that I do not know your story and you don’t know
me. If you accuse me of being that child’s father,
you are telling a falsehood. Do you understand
what a falsehood is, Jean?”</p>

<p>His face was so stern that the girl cowered.</p>

<p>“No,” she whimpered, “I—I won’t tell, I swore
it, I won’t tell his name.”</p>

<p>“Neither will you take mine in vain,” said Caleb
Trench, and he lifted the sobbing Sammy.</p>

<p>Cowed, Jean followed, and the strange procession
trailed down the white road. Overhead the tall
hickories were in flower. The carriage of Colonel
Royall had cast dust on Trench’s gray tweed suit
and it had powdered Shot’s rough hair. The dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
trailed jealously at his heels, not giving precedence
to Jean Bartlett. The girl walked droopingly, and
now that the fire of conviction had died out of her
face, it was shrunken again, like a thin paper mask
from behind which there had flashed, for a moment,
a Hallowe’en candle. They began to pass people.
Aaron Todd, stout farmer and lumberman, rode by in
his wagon and nodded to Trench, staring at the child.
Jean he knew. Then came two more farmers, and
later a backwoodsman, who greeted Trench as he
galloped past on his lean, mud-bespattered horse.
Then two women passed on the farther side. They
spoke to Trench timidly, for he was a reserved man
and they did not know him well, but they drew
away their skirts from Jean, who was the Shameful
Thing at Paradise Ridge.</p>

<p>Strange thoughts beset Caleb; suddenly the girl’s
accusation went home; suppose he had been the
father of this child on his arm,—would they pass
him and speak, and pass her with skirts drawn
aside? God knew. He thought it only too probable,
knowing men—and women. He was a just man on
occasions, but at heart a passionate one. Inwardly
he stormed, outwardly he was calm. The dog trailed
behind him; so did the girl, a broken thing, who had
just sense enough to feel the women’s eyes. They
passed more people. Again Caleb answered salutations,
again he heard the girl whimper as if she
shrank from a blow.</p>

<p>At her own door, which was her grandmother’s,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
he set down the child. A shrill voice began screaming.
“Is the hussy there? Come in with you, you thing
of shame; what d’ye walk in the road for? The
Ridge is fair screamin’ with your disgrace, you
trollop. Jean, Jean!”</p>

<p>The old woman was childish, but she knew the tale
and retained it. There was also a half-foolish brother;
it seemed as if, in the making of this luckless family,
the usual three pints of wits had been spilled to a
half pint and then diluted to go around. Zeb Bartlett
came to the door, shambling and dirty, but grinning
at the sight of Trench. Sammy ran from him shrieking,
for he feared the theft of his spoils. Zeb towered
in righteous wrath as Jean appeared.</p>

<p>“Get in, Shameless!” he commanded.</p>

<p>The girl shrank past him sobbing.</p>

<p>“My God!” said Caleb Trench and turned away.</p>

<p>He did not heed an appeal for help to get work that
Zeb shouted after him; he was, for the moment,
deaf. Before him lay the broad fields and sloping
hills, the beauty of earth and sky, drenched in sunset;
behind lay a girl’s purgatory. He forgot his
anger at her senseless accusation, he forgot the peril
of it, in his wrath; he hated injustice. Only the
yellow dog followed at his heels and his heart was full
of strange thoughts. Five years of isolation and injustice
must tell in a man’s life, and the purposes
born there in solitude are grim. The great trial that
was to divide Eshcol against itself was growing,
growing out of the sweet spring twilight, growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
beyond the song of the thrush and the cheep of the
woodpecker, growing in the heart of a man.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jacob Eaton had called Trench the
father of Jean Bartlett’s child, and old Scipio, who
drove the colonel’s bays, heard it and told it to Kingdom-Come
Carter, who had been butler at Broad
Acres for fifty years, and had carried Diana in his
arms when she was two weeks old. Kingdom-Come
told it to Aunt Charity and Uncle Juniper, coal-black
negroes of the cabin, and thus by kitchens
and alley-doors the story traveled, as a needle will
travel through the body and work its way to the
surface. The reputation of a man is but the breath
on a servant’s lips, as man himself is compared to
grass and the flower of it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TRENCH walked slowly homeward. Colonel
Royall’s place, the largest of its kind in the
neighborhood of Eshcol, was on a hill above
the town, and Trench’s nearest path lay not by the
highroad but past the Colonel’s gates along a lovely
trail that led through a growth of stunted cedars
out into the open ground above the river, and
thence by a solitary and wooded path known sometimes
as the Trail of the Cedar-bird, because those
little birds haunted it at certain seasons of the year.</p>

<p>It was now broad moonlight, and Trench, who was
peculiarly susceptible to the sights and sounds of
Nature, was aware of the beauty of every tremulous
shadow. The chill spring air was sweet with the aromatic
perfume of pines and cedars, and, as he turned
the shoulder of the hill, his eye swept the new-plowed
fields. He could smell the grapevines that were
blooming in masses by the wayside, promising a full
harvest of those great purple grapes that had given
the settlement its name. Below him the river forked,
and in its elbow nestled the center of the village, the
church at the Cross-Roads, and the little red schoolhouse
where Peter Mahan had fought Jacob Eaton
and whipped him at the age of twelve, long before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
Caleb Trench had even heard of Eshcol. To the left
was the Friends’ Meeting-House, Judge Hollis’ home,
and the lane which led to Trench’s shop and office.
Beyond, he discerned the little old white house where
Dr. William Cheyney lived, but that was where Eshcol
lapped over on to Little Paradise, for they had bridged
the creek ten years before. Across the river lay the
city, big and smoky and busy, its spires rising above
its shining roofs.</p>

<p>A light mist, diaphanous and shimmering, floated
over the lowlands by the water, and above it the dark
green of the young foliage and the lovely slope of
clovered fields seemed to assume a new and beautiful
significance, to suggest mysterious unfoldings, buds
and blossoming time, the gathered promise of a hundred
springs, that mysterious awakening of life which
stirred the lonely man’s imagination with a thrill of
pleasure as poignant as it was unusual. To him these
lonely walks at sunrise and moonrise had been his
greatest solace, and there was a companionship in
the slight hushed sounds of woodland life which approached
his inner consciousness more nearly than the
alien existence that circumstances had forced upon
him. He was a stranger in almost a strange land.
He had been born and brought up in Philadelphia,
and his family belonged to the Society of Friends.
Personally, Caleb Trench was not orthodox, but the
bias of his early training held, and the poverty that
had followed his father’s business failure had tended
to increase the simplicity of the boy’s narrowed life.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
When death had intervened and taken first his father,
whom business ruin had broken, and then his mother
and sister, Caleb had severed the last tie that bound
him to the East and started West to make his fortune,
with the boundless confidence of youth that he
would succeed. The lodestar that has drawn so many
on that fantastic quest had drawn him, and failing in
first one venture and then another, because it is
easier to buy experience than to accumulate wealth,
he had come at last to the little shop at Eshcol and
the study of law. Wherein lay the touchstone of his
life, though he knew it not.</p>

<p>Pausing now, a moment, to view his favorite scene,
the lowlands by the river under their silvery mantle
of vapor, he turned and took the sharp descent from
the bluff to the old turnpike. A cherry tree in full
bloom stood like a ghost at the corner of Judge Hollis’
orchard, and the long lane was white with the falling
petals. A light shone warmly through the crimson
curtains of Judge Hollis’ library window, and Caleb
took the familiar path to the side door. The latch
was usually down, but to-night he had to knock, and
the judge’s sister, Miss Sarah, opened the door.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Caleb?” she said, in her high thin
voice; “wipe your feet. I wish men folks were all
made like cherubs anyway, then there wouldn’t be
all this mud tracked over my carpets.”</p>

<p>“We might moult our wing feathers, Miss Sarah,”
Caleb ventured unsmilingly, while he obeyed his instructions
to the letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“I’d as lief have feathers as pipe ashes,” she retorted;
“in fact I’d rather—I could make pillows
of ’em.”</p>

<p>“You can’t complain of my pipe ashes, Miss Sarah,”
Trench said, a slow laugh dawning in the depths of
his gray eyes. “Is the judge at home?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you smell tobacco smoke?” she replied,
moving in front of him across the entry, her tall
figure, in its plain green poplin with the turn-down
collar of Irish lace, recalling to Trench, in the most
extreme of contrasts, the other tall figure in its beautiful
evening dress, that had stood so haughtily in
Colonel Royall’s drawing-room, seeming to him the
most perfect expression of beauty and charming grace
that he had ever seen, though he still felt the sting of
Diana’s glance and the sarcasm of her receipt. He
had carried the money back in good faith, for his
Quaker training made six cents as significant to him
as six hundred cents, but, under all his strong and
apparently unmoved exterior, there was a quick perception
of the attitude of others toward his views and
toward himself. In the strength of his own virile
character he had not fully realized where he stood in
her eyes, but after that night he did not forget it.
Meanwhile, Miss Sarah had opened the study door.</p>

<p>“Judge,” she called to her brother, “Caleb’s
here.”</p>

<p>There was no response, and she went away, leaving
Caleb to find his own welcome. He went in and closed
the door. Judge Hollis was sitting at his desk smoking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
a long black pipe and writing carefully in a hand
as fine and accurate as a steel engraving.</p>

<p>The room was low, papered with old-fashioned
bandbox paper and filled with bookcases with glass
doors, every one of which hung open. In the corner
was a life-sized bust of Daniel Webster. As Caleb
entered, the judge swung around in his revolving
chair and eyed him over his spectacles. He was a
big man with a large head covered with abundant
white hair, a clean-shaven face with a huge nose,
shaped like a hawk’s and placed high between the
deep-set eyes.</p>

<p>“Trench,” he said abruptly, “if they elect Aylett
they’ll have to stuff the ballot-boxes. What’ll you
do then?”</p>

<p>“Take the stuffing out of them, Judge,” Trench
replied promptly and decisively.</p>

<p>The judge looked at him, a grim smile curling the
corners of his large mouth. “They’ll tar and feather
you,” he said.</p>

<p>Trench sat down and took up a calf-bound volume.
“I’m enough of a Quaker still to speak out in meeting,”
he observed.</p>

<p>“The only thing I know about Quakers makes ’em
seem like Unitarians,” said the judge, “and a Unitarian
is a kind of stylish Jew. What have you
been doing with the backwoodsmen, Caleb? Mahan
tells me they’re organized—” the judge smiled outright now—“I
don’t believe it.”</p>

<p>Caleb Trench smiled too. “I don’t know much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
about organizing, Judge,” he said simply. “When
men come into my shop and ask questions I answer
them; that’s all there is about it.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to shut up that shop, I reckon,” the
judge said, “but then you’ll open your darned law
office and give ’em sedition by the brief instead of by
the yard. I deserve hanging for letting you read
law here. I’ve been a Democrat for seventy years,
and you’re a black Republican.”</p>

<p>Trench closed the law book on his finger. “Judge,”
he said slowly, “I’m a man of my own convictions.
My father wouldn’t stand for anything I do, yet he
was the best man I ever knew, and I’d like to be true
to him. It isn’t in me to follow in the beaten track,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>The judge twinkled. “You’re an iconoclast,” he
said, “and so’s Sarah, yet women, as a rule, are safe
conservatives. They’ll hang on to an old idea as
close as a hen to a nest-egg. Perhaps I’m the same.
Anyway I can’t stand for your ways; I wash my
hands of it all. I wish they’d drop Yarnall; his
nomination means blood on the face of the moon.
There’s the feud with the Eatons, and I wouldn’t
trust Jacob Eaton to forget it, not by a darned sight;
he’s too pesky cold-blooded,—the kind of man
that holds venom as long as a rattler.”</p>

<p>“Then, if you don’t like Yarnall, why not vote for
Mahan?” Trench was beginning to enjoy himself.
He leaned back in his chair with his head against a
shelf of the bookcase, the light from the judge’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
lamp falling full on his remarkable face, clean-shaven
like his host’s, on the strong line of the jaw, and on
the mouth that had the faculty of locking itself in
granite lines.</p>

<p>“Because, damn it, I’m a Democrat!” said the
old man angrily.</p>

<p>“By conviction or habit?”</p>

<p>The judge scowled. “By conviction first, sir, and
by habit last, and for good and all, anyway!”</p>

<p>Caleb Trench laughed softly. “Judge,” he said,
“what of Jacob Eaton?”</p>

<p>The judge shot a quick look from under scowling
brows. “Seen him lately?”</p>

<p>The younger man thought a moment. “Yes,
last night. I owed Miss Royall some change and
took it to the house. Eaton was there.”</p>

<p>“How much change?” asked Hollis abruptly.</p>

<p>“Six cents.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>Trench reddened. “Six cents,” he repeated
doggedly.</p>

<p>“And you took it up there and paid Diana Royall?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Judge, in the drawing-room; she gave
me a receipt.”</p>

<p>The judge exploded with laughter; he roared and
slapped his knee.</p>

<p>Caleb Trench bore it well, but the color of his eyes,
which was blue-gray, became more gray than blue.
“I owed it,” he said.</p>

<p>At which the judge laughed more. Then he dropped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
back into his old attitude and wiped his eyes. “You
walked up there—seven miles—to see Diana?”</p>

<p>Trench stiffened. “No,” he said flatly, “I did not;
I’ve got more sense. I know perfectly how Miss
Royall estimates a shopkeeper,” he added, with a
bitterness which he could not suppress.</p>

<p>The judge looked at him curiously. “How do you
know?” he asked.</p>

<p>Trench returned his look without a word, and Judge
Hollis colored; it was not the first time that the
young man had rebuked him and let him know that
he could not trespass on forbidden ground. The
old lawyer fingered his brief an instant in annoyed
silence, then he spoke of something else.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you about the feud,” he said irrelevantly;
“it began seventy years ago over a piece of ground
that lay between the two properties; Christopher
Yarnall claimed it and so did Jacob Eaton, this man’s
grandfather. There was a fence war for years, then
Yarnall won. Winfield Mahan, Peter’s grandfather,
won by a fifteen-hour speech. They said the jurymen
all fell asleep in the box and voted in a nightmare.
Anyway he got it, and Mahan got more money
for the case than the whole place was worth. That
was the beginning. Chris Yarnall’s son married a
pretty girl from Lexington, and she fell in love with
Eaton, Jacob’s father. There was a kind of fatality
about the way those two families got mixed up.
Everybody saw how things were going except Jinny
Eaton, his wife. She was playing belle at Memphis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
and Jacob was about a year old. Eaton tried to run
away with Mrs. Yarnall, that’s the size of it, and
Yarnall shot him. There was a big trial and the
Eatons claimed that Eaton was innocent. Young
Mrs. Yarnall swore he was, and fainted on the stand,
but the Yarnalls knew he wasn’t innocent, and they
got Yarnall off. He wouldn’t live with his wife after
that; there was a divorce and he married a Miss Sarah
Garnett. This Garnett Yarnall, they want to run, is
his son. Of course the whole Eaton clan hate the
Yarnalls like the devil, and Jacob hates Garnett
worse than that, because he’s never been able to
run him. Jacob likes to run things in a groove; he’s
a smart fellow, is Jacob.”</p>

<p>Trench said nothing; he had filled his pipe and sat
smoking, the law book closed on his finger. The
judge swung back in his chair and clasped his hands
behind his head.</p>

<p>“Of course he’ll marry Diana Royall. They’re
fourth cousins; Jinny is the colonel’s second cousin,
on his mother’s side; there’s a good deal of money
in the family, and I reckon they want to keep it there.
Anyway, Jacob’s set his mind—I’m not saying his
heart, for I don’t know that he’s got one—on getting
Diana; that’s as plain as the nose on a man’s
face, but Diana—well, there’s a proposition for
you!” and the judge chuckled.</p>

<p>Trench knocked the ashes from his pipe very carefully
into a little cracked china plate that Miss Sarah
provided for the judge, and the judge never used.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
“Eaton is interested in some speculating schemes,
isn’t he?” he asked, without referring to Diana.</p>

<p>The judge nodded. “He’s president of a company
developing some lands in Oklahoma, and he’s
connected in Wall Street; Jacob’s a smart fellow.”</p>

<p>“Colonel Royall is interested, too, I suppose,”
Trench suggested tentatively.</p>

<p>“Yep, got pretty much all his spare cash in, I
reckon; the colonel loves to speculate. It’s in the
blood, one way or another. His grandfather kept
the finest race-horses in the South, and his father lost
a small fortune on them. Of course David has to
dip in, but he’s never been much for horses. Besides,
he had a blow; his wife—” The judge stopped
abruptly and looked up.</p>

<p>The door of the study had been opening softly and
closing again for the last few minutes. As he paused
it opened wider, and a woolly head came in cautiously.</p>

<p>“What is it, Juniper?” he asked impatiently.
“Don’t keep a two-inch draught on my back; come
in or stay out.”</p>

<p>The old negro opened the door wide enough to
squeeze his lean body through and closed it behind
him.</p>

<p>“Evenin’, Jedge,” he said; “evenin’, Marse
Trench.”</p>

<p>“What do you want now?” demanded the judge,
taking off his spectacles to polish them. There was
the ghost of a smile about his grim lips.</p>

<p>Juniper turned his hat around slowly and looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
into the crown; it was a battered old gray felt and he
saw the pattern of the carpet through a hole in it.
“I’ve laid off ter ask yo’ how much it wud cost ter
git er divorce, suh?”</p>

<p>Judge Hollis put on his spectacles and looked at
him thoughtfully. “Depends on the circumstances,
Juniper,” he replied. “I suppose Aunt Charity is
tired of you at last?”</p>

<p>“No, suh, <i>she</i> ain’t, but I ez,” said Juniper indignantly;
“she done b’haved so onerary dat I’se sho
gwine ter be divorced, I ez, ef it don’ cost too much,”
he added dolefully.</p>

<p>The judge’s eyes twinkled. “You’ll have to pay
her alimony,” he said.</p>

<p>“What’s dat?” Juniper demanded with anxiety.</p>

<p>“So much a week out of your wages,” explained
Trench, catching the judge’s eye.</p>

<p>“I ain’t gwine ter do it, noways,” said Juniper
firmly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you have to support her now?” Trench
asked mildly.</p>

<p>Juniper looked up at the ceiling thoughtfully.
“I’se allus been proud ob de way she done washin’,
suh,” he said; “she sho do mek money dat away,
an’ I ain’t gwine ter complain ob noffin but de way
she behaved ’bout Miss Eaton’s silver teapot, dat
Miss Jinny done gib me fo’ a birthday present.”</p>

<p>“Silver teapot?” Caleb Trench looked questioningly
at the judge.</p>

<p>“Juniper had a birthday,” Judge Hollis explained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
grimly, “and Aunt Charity gave him a birthday
party. I reckon we all sent Juniper something, but
Jinny Eaton gave him a silver-plated teapot, and
there have been squalls ever since. Who’s got that
teapot now, Juniper?”</p>

<p>“She hab,” said Juniper indignantly. “I locked
dat teapot in my trunk, Judge, an’ I done tole her
dat she couldn’t hab it when I died bekase she’d
gib it ter dat mean trash son ob hers, Lysander, an’
when I wus out she done got a locksmith ter gib her
a key ter fit dat trunk, an’ she got dat teapot, an’
she’s gwine ter gib tea ter Deacon Plato Eaton, an’
he hab er wife already, not sayin’ noffin ’bout concubines.
I ain’t gwine ter hab him drinkin’ no tea
outen dat silver teapot dat Miss Jinny done gib me.
I’se gwine ter git divorcement an’ I wants dat
teapot.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you settle it with Uncle Plato?”
asked the judge. “Assault and battery is cheaper
than divorce.”</p>

<p>Juniper rubbed the back of his head thoughtfully.
“De fact ez, Jedge,” he said, “I ain’t sho dat I’se
gwine ter whip him.”</p>

<p>“Juniper,” said the judge, “you tell Uncle Plato
from me that if he drinks tea out of that teapot
you’ll sue him for ten thousand dollars damages for
alienating your wife’s affections.”</p>

<p>Juniper looked at him admiringly. “I sho will,
Jedge,” he said. “Alyanatying her ’fections! I sho
will! Dat sounds mos’ ez bad ez settin’ fire ter de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
cou’t-house. I ’low Plato ain’t gwine ter cotch et ef
he kin help it. I sho ez grateful ter yo’ all, Jedge.”</p>

<p>The judge swung his revolving chair around to
his desk. “Very good,” he said grimly; “you can
go now, Juniper.”</p>

<p>The old man turned and shuffled back to the door;
as he opened it he bowed again. “Alyanatying her
’fections! I ’low I ain’t gwine ter fergit dat. Evenin’,
gentermen,” and he closed the door.</p>

<p>The judge looked across at Caleb. “That’s one
of the Eaton faction,” he remarked grimly. “Yarnall
has to contend with that kind of cattle. Juniper’s
sold, body and soul, to the Eatons, and that old fool,
Jinny Eaton, gave him a silver-plated teapot for his
birthday. You might as well give a nigger a diamond
sunburst or a tame bear. He and his wife have been
at swords’ points ever since, but as sure as the first
Tuesday in November comes, that whole black horde
will vote the Eaton ticket.”</p>

<p>Caleb Trench regarded the judge thoughtfully.
“You’d like to disfranchise the negro,” he remarked.</p>

<p>Hollis grunted. “You’re a black Republican,”
he said bitingly.</p>

<p>Trench shook his head. “No, sir, a conservative,”
he replied, “but an honest man, I hope. I haven’t
much more use for the ignorant black vote than you
have, but that question isn’t the one that hits me,
Judge.”</p>

<p>The judge looked keenly at the grim composure of
the face opposite. “What does?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“Dishonesty, fraud, and intimidation,” Trench
answered.</p>

<p>“And you propose to oppose and expose them?”
The old man was keenly interested, his heavy brows
drawn down, his eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>Judge Hollis rose and went over to the younger
man. He laid his hand on his shoulder. “You’re a
poor man, Trench; they’ll ruin you.”</p>

<p>“So be it.”</p>

<p>“You’re alone; they’ll kill you,” warned the
judge.</p>

<p>Trench rose, and as his tall figure towered, the fine
width of his brow and the peculiar lucidity of his
glance had never seemed more striking. Judge Hollis
watched him in grim admiration.</p>

<p>“I’ve got but one life,” he said, “and, as God sees
me, I’ll live that life in fear of no man.”</p>

<p>The judge walked slowly back to his seat, took off
his spectacles and laid them down beside his brief.
“Reckon Jacob Eaton’s got his match at last,” he
said, “and, by the Lord Harry, I’m glad of it!”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DIANA ROYALL turned her horse’s head
from the highroad and began to descend the
Trail of the Cedar-bird. It was late afternoon,
and the glory of the west was suddenly obscured
with a bank of purple clouds; the distant
rumble of thunder jarred the stillness, and a moisture,
the promise of heavy rain, filled the air. Long
streamers of angry clouds drifted across the upper
sky, and far off the tall pines stirred restlessly.</p>

<p>Regardless of these threatenings of Nature, Diana
rode on, under the interlacing boughs, swaying forward
sometimes in her saddle to avoid a sweeping
branch, while her horse picked his way in the narrow
path, often sending a loose stone rolling ahead of
them or crackling a fallen limb. Through long aisles
of young green she caught glimpses of the river;
now and then a frightened rabbit scurried across the
path or a squirrel chattered overhead. She loved
the voices of the wild things, the fragrant stillness of
the pinewoods, the perfume of young blossomings.
She brought her horse to a walk, passing slowly
along the trail; even the soft young leaves that
brushed against her shoulder were full of friendships.
She loved the red tips of the maples, and the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
buds of the hemlocks; she knew where she ought to
hear the sweet call—“Bob White!”—and once,
before the clouds threatened so darkly, she caught
the note of a song-sparrow. Life was sweet; there
was a joy merely in living, and she tried to crowd
out of her mind that little angry prick of mortification
that had stung her ever since she met the eyes
of Caleb Trench across her receipt. He had known
that she mocked him, had scorned to notice it, and
had showed that he was stronger mentally than she
was. In that single instant Diana had felt herself
small, malicious, discourteous, and the thought of
it was like the taste of wormwood. She resented it,
and resenting it, blamed herself less than she blamed
Trench. Why had he come on such a silly errand?
Why had he tempted her to rudeness? The question
had fretted her for weeks; for weeks she had avoided
passing the little old house at the Cross-Roads where
Caleb had lived now for three years. Yet, when she
came to the opening in the cedars, she drew near unconsciously
and looked down at the old worn gable
of his roof. It faced northeast, and there was moss
on its shingles; she saw a little thin trail of smoke
clinging close to the lip of the chimney, for the atmosphere
was heavy.</p>

<p>Then she turned impatiently in the saddle, breaking
her vagrant thoughts away from the solitary man,
secretly angry that she had thought of him at all.
Her glance fell on a mass of blossoming wild honeysuckle,
and the loveliness of its rose tintings drew her;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
she slipped to the ground and patting her horse, left
the bridle loose on his neck. She had to gather up
her skirts and thread her way through a bracken of
ferns before she reached the tempting flowers and
began to gather them. She broke off a few sprays
and clustered them in her hands, pausing to look out
across the newly plowed fields to her right; they had
been sown to oats, and it seemed to her that she saw
the first faint drift of green on the crests of the furrows.
The next moment a crash of thunder shook
the air, the trees overhead cracked and bent low before
the onrush of the sudden gust. Her horse, a
restive creature, shied violently and stood shivering
with fear. Diana, grasping her flowers, started
through the ferns, calling to him, but a blinding flash
followed by more thunder forestalled her; the horse
rose on his haunches and stood an instant, quivering,
a beautiful untamed creature, his mane flying in the
wind, and then plunged forward and galloped down
the trail.</p>

<p>Diana called to him again helplessly and foolishly,
for her voice was lost in the crackling of boughs and
the boom of thunder; she was alone in the lonely
spot, with the wind whistling in her ears. It ripped
the leaves from the trees overhead and she stood in
a hail of green buds. The fury of the gale increased,
the black clouds advanced across the heavens with long
streamers flying ahead of them, the light in the upper
sky went out, darkness increased; suddenly the
woods were twilight and she heard no sound but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
mighty rush of the wind. As yet no rain fell, only
leaves, broken twigs, and, at last, great branches
crashed. The lightning tore the clouds apart in
fearful rents.</p>

<p>It was a long way home, seven and a half miles,
and already big drops spattered through the trees.
Strangely enough, a thought of Caleb’s walk with
the six cents flashed in upon her and she resented it.
Yet the nearest shelter was the little shop at the
Cross-Roads. It made no difference, she would face
the storm; and she started boldly down the trail
though the bushes whipped against her skirt and the
boughs threatened her. Once a rolling stone nearly
threw her down, but she kept resolutely on. If the
horse went home riderless, what would they think?
She could only dimly conjecture Colonel Royall’s
distress, but she would not go to the little shop to
telephone; she would walk home!</p>

<p>She kept steadily on. Twice the force of the wind
almost drove her back; twice she had to stop and
steady herself against a tree trunk. The thought
came to her that she had been foolish to stay out so
long, but she scarcely heeded it now, for the wind
had torn her hat off and loosened her hair, and it
was whipping her clothes about and tearing at her
like a malicious spirit. She reached the end of the
path and came into the turnpike just as the rain
came in a blinding sheet, white as sea-spray, and
closed down around her with a rush of water like a
cloudburst. She kept on with difficulty now, scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
seeing her way, and another rolling stone caught her
foot. She stumbled and nearly fell, straightening
herself with an agony darting through her ankle; she
had given it a sharp twist and it no longer bore her
weight without anguish. She reeled against a fence
at the wayside and held to it, trying to be sure that
she was in the road. Then another flash showed her
the shop at the Cross-Roads, not twenty feet away.
An hour before she could not have imagined her joy at
seeing it, now she had only the hope that she could
reach it. The pain in her ankle increased, and her
drenched clothes clung to her; she pulled herself
forward slowly, clinging to the fence. The roar of the
wind filled the world, and the rain drove in her face.</p>

<p>She did not see the man in the door of the shop;
she did not know that, looking at the storm, he saw a
figure clinging to the fence, but she suddenly felt
herself lifted from the ground and borne forward in
strong arms. Then something seemed to snap in
her brain, she swam in darkness for a moment, with
the throb of pain reaching up to her heart, before she
lost even the consciousness of that.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when light began to filter back, she
was being carried still, and almost instantly full comprehension
returned. She was aware that it was
Caleb Trench who carried her, and that he did it
easily, though she was no light burden. He was
taking her from the shop into his office beyond when
she recovered, and she roused herself with an effort
and tried to slip to the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“Be careful,” he said quickly, with an authority in
his tone which, even at that moment, reached her;
“you may have sprained or broken your ankle, I do
not know which.” And he carried her to a plain old
leather lounge in the corner and put her gently down.
“Are you in pain?” he asked, turning up the lamp
which he had already lighted.</p>

<p>The light fell on his face as well as upon hers, and as
she looked up, Diana was impressed with the vivid
force, the directness, the self-absorption of the man’s
look. If her presence there meant anything to him,
if he had felt her beauty and her charm as she lay
helpless in his arms, he gave no sign. It was a look
of power, of reserve, of iron will; she was suddenly
conscious of an impulse to answer him as simply as a
child.</p>

<p>“It is nothing,” she said; “I don’t believe I’m
even hurt much. Where did you find me?”</p>

<p>“Almost at my door,” he replied, moving quietly
to a kind of cupboard at the other side of the room
and pouring some brandy into a glass. “You must
drink this; your clothing is soaked through and I
have nothing dry to offer you, but if you can, come
to the fire.”</p>

<p>Diana took the liquor and drank it obediently, unconsciously
yielding to the calm authority of his manner.
Then she tried to rise, but once on her feet,
staggered, and would have fallen but for his arm.
He caught her and held her erect a moment, then
gathered her up without a word, and carried her to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
a seat by the little open stove into which he had
already thrown some wood. Diana sank into his old
armchair with crimson cheeks. She was half angry,
half amused; he was treating her like an injured
child, and with as little heed of her grand-dame manners
as if she had been six years old.</p>

<p>“I have telephoned to Dr. Cheyney,” he said simply,
“but, of course, this storm will delay him.”</p>

<p>“I am not ill,” Diana protested. “I am not even
badly hurt; my horse ran away, and I—I think I
sprained my ankle.”</p>

<p>“You were clinging to the fence,” Trench said,
without apparent emotion, “and you fainted when I
lifted you.”</p>

<p>She sickened at the memory, yet was woman enough
to resent the man’s indifference. “I’m sorry you
’phoned for poor old Dr. Cheyney,” she said stiffly;
“please ’phone to my people to send for me.”</p>

<p>“I tried,” he replied, undisturbed by her hauteur,
“but the storm must have interfered. I can’t get
them, and now I can’t get Dr. Cheyney.”</p>

<p>“How long was I unconscious?” she asked quickly,
trying to piece together her recovery and all that he
had done.</p>

<p>“Ten minutes,” he answered. “I saw the horse
going by riderless and went out to look. It seemed
a long time before I saw you coming and carried you
into the shop. I thought you were not coming to,
and you were so soaked with water that I had lifted
you to bring you to the fire when you recovered.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“I hope Jerry got home,” she said thoughtfully.
“It was my folly; I saw how black the clouds were,
and I ought to have gone home.”</p>

<p>Trench stooped for more wood and fed the fire, the
glow lighting up his face again. “Where were you?”
he asked simply, and then “I beg your pardon—”</p>

<p>“I was up the trail,” she said quietly. “I stayed
too long. It was beautiful; all the young things are
budding. I dismounted to gather some wild honeysuckle—and
it is gone!”</p>

<p>For the first time his eyes met hers with a glow of
understanding. “Did you notice the turn above the
river?” he asked, still feeding the fire.</p>

<p>She smiled reluctantly. “How white the cucumber
is,” she answered, “and did you see the red tips of
the maples? How glossy the new green leaves look!”</p>

<p>“There is a place there, where the old hickory fell,
where you can see the orchard and that low meadow
by the lane—” His face was almost boyish, eager
for sympathy, awakened, changed.</p>

<p>“It is beautiful,” Diana replied, nodding, “and one
hears the Bob White there.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he breathed softly, “you noticed?”</p>

<p>Diana leaned her elbow on the worn arm of his
chair and nestled her chin in her hand, watching him.
After all, what manner of man was he?</p>

<p>The storm, still raging in all its fury, shook the house
to its foundation; a deafening crash of thunder seemed
to demolish all other sounds. She glanced covertly
about the little room, seeking some explanation there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
A village shopkeeper who was by nature a poet and a
mystic, and of whom men spoke as a politician—there
was a paradox. Something like amusement
touched the edge of her thought, but she tried for the
first time to understand. The room was small and
lined on two sides with rough bookshelves made of
unstained pine, yet there was a picturesqueness in
the medley of old books, grouped carelessly about
them. There were a few old worn leather chairs and
the lounge, a faded rug, a table littered with papers
and pens around the shaded lamp, beside which lay
his pipe. His dog, Shot, a yellow nondescript, lay
across the threshold, nose between paws, watching
her suspiciously. The place was homely yet severe,
clean but disorderly, and the strangest touch of all
was the big loose bunch of apple-blossoms in an old
earthen jar in the corner, the pink and white of the
fragile blooms contrasting charmingly with the dull
tintings of the earthenware, and bringing the fragrance
of spring into the little room. Their grouping,
and the corner in which he had placed them, where
the light just caught the beauty of the delicate petals,
arrested Diana’s thought.</p>

<p>“You are an artist,” she remarked approvingly;
“or else—was it an accident?”</p>

<p>He followed her glance and smiled, and she noticed
that, in spite of the rugged strength and homeliness
of his face, his rare smile had almost the sweetness of
a woman’s. “Not altogether accident,” he said, “but
the falling of the light which seems to lift them out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
of the shadows behind them. Isn’t it fair that I
should have something beautiful in this shabby
place?”</p>

<p>Diana colored; had he noticed her survey and
again thought her discourteous? She could say
nothing to refute its shabbiness and, for the moment,
her usual tact deserted her. She sat looking at the
apple-blossoms in silence while he rose from his place
as fire-feeder, and, going to the kitchen, came back
with a cup of hot tea.</p>

<p>“You had better drink this,” he advised quietly;
“I’m afraid you’ll take cold. I hope the tea will
be right; you see I am ‘the cook and the captain
too.’”</p>

<p>She took the cup, obediently again, and feeling like
a naughty child. “It is excellent,” she said, tasting it;
“I didn’t know a mere man could make such good
tea.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Once or twice, you know, men have
led a forlorn hope. I sometimes feel like that when I
attack the domestic mysteries.”</p>

<p>“Courage has its own rewards—even in tea, then!”
she retorted, wondering if all the men who lived thus
alone knew how to do so many things for themselves?
In her experience it had been the other way. Colonel
Royall was as helpless as a baby and needed almost
as much care, and Jacob Eaton had a scornful disregard
of domestic details, only demanding his own
comforts, and expecting that his adoring mother would
provide them without annoying him with even the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
ways and means. It occurred to Diana that, perhaps,
it was the wide difference in social position, that gentlemen
might be helpless in matters where the humbler
denizens of the earth had to be accomplished; that,
in short, Caleb Trench must make his own tea or go
without, while Jacob Eaton could pay for the making
of an indefinite succession of cups of tea. Yet, was
this man entirely out of her class? Diana tasted the
tea, with a critical appreciation of its admirable qualities,
and quietly viewed the tea-maker. He was seated
again now in the old armchair by the table, and she
observed the strong lines of his long-fingered muscular
hands, the pose and firmness of the unquestionably intellectual
head. There was nothing commonplace,
nothing unrefined in his aspect, yet all her training
went to place between them an immeasurable social
chasm. She regarded him curiously, as one might regard
the habitant of another and an inferior hemisphere,
and he was poignantly aware of her mental
attitude. Neither spoke for a while, and nothing was
audible in the room but the crash and uproar of the
storm without. In contrast, the light and shelter of
the little place seemed like a flower-scented refuge
from pandemonium. Diana looked over her teacup
at the silent man, who seemed less ill at ease than she
was.</p>

<p>“I think you are a stranger here, Mr. Trench,” she
said, in her soft voice; “at least, we who have been
here twenty years call every one else a stranger and
a sojourner in the land.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“I have been here only three years,” he replied,
“but I do not feel myself altogether a stranger—to
backwoodsmen,” he added ironically.</p>

<p>She glanced up quickly, recalling the talk between
her father and Jacob Eaton. “Is it you who are organizing
them?” she asked lightly.</p>

<p>Her question took him by surprise, and he showed
it; it seemed like an echo of old Judge Hollis. “I’m
no organizer, Miss Royall,” he replied simply, stooping
to caress the dog, who had come to lay his rough
head against his knee.</p>

<p>She smiled; something in his manner, an indefinable
distinction and fineness, began to make her feel
at ease with him. “Is that mere modesty?” she
asked. “I wish you would tell me—I love politics
and,” she laughed gently, “I’m profoundly ignorant.”</p>

<p>His rare smile lighted the repose of his strong face
again. “I am not a desirable teacher for you, Miss
Royall,” he replied; “I’m that abnormal thing, that
black sheep in the neighborhood, a Republican.”</p>

<p>She leaned over and set her empty cup on the table.
“I am immensely interested,” she said. “A Republican
is almost as curious as the famed ‘Jabberwock.’
It isn’t possible that you are making Republicans up
in the timberlands?”</p>

<p>“Some one must have told you so,” he retorted
quietly, a flicker of humor in his grave eyes; “they
look upon me here as they would on a fox in a
chicken-yard.”</p>

<p>She colored; she did not want to speak of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
father or her cousin. “You see what a busy thing
rumor is,” she said.</p>

<p>“You divine how harmless I am,” he went on,
stooping again to throw another stick into the blaze;
“a single Republican in a wilderness of Democrats.
I’m no better than one old woodchuck in a
cornfield.”</p>

<p>“A little leaven will leaven the whole lump,” she
laughed.</p>

<p>Her new tone, which was easy now and almost
friendly, touched him and melted his reserve; he
looked up smiling and caught her beauty and warmth,
the lovely contour of her face. Her hat had been lost,
and the fire was drying her moist hair, which was
loosened in soft curls about her forehead. Her presence
there began to reach the man’s inner consciousness,
from which he had been trying to shut her
out. He was fighting to bar his thought against her,
and her lovely presence in his room seemed to diffuse
a warmth and color and happiness that made his
pulses throb more quickly. Even the dog felt her
benign influence and looked up at her approvingly.
Trench steadied his mind to answer her banter in
her own tone.</p>

<p>“The lump will reject the leaven first, I fear,” he
said lightly; “I never dreamed of such vivid convictions
with so little knowledge,” he added. “I come
from a race of calm reasoners; my people were
Quakers.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” She blushed as the exclamation escaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
her, for she had suddenly remembered the six cents
and understood the absurdity of his seven-mile walk;
it was the Quaker in him. “I know nothing in the
world about Quakers beyond their—their—”</p>

<p>“Hats?” he laughed; “like cardinals, they have
that distinction.”</p>

<p>“Do you think me very ignorant?” she asked, unconscious
that she was bridging the social chasm
again and again, that she had, indeed, forgotten it
in her interest in the man. His dog had come over
now and laid his head in Diana’s lap, and she caressed
it unconsciously; the dumb overture of friendship
always touched her.</p>

<p>Trench turned. The firelight was on both their
faces, and he met her eyes with that luminous glance
which seemed to compel hers. “It would be very
difficult for me to tell you what I think of you,” he
said deliberately, but with a humorous kindness in
his voice.</p>

<p>Diana drew back; she was not sure that she was
annoyed. It was new, it was almost delightful to meet
a primitive person like this. She could not be sure of
social banalities here; he might say something new,
something that stirred her pulses at any moment. It
was an alarming but distinctly pleasurable sensation,
this excursion into another sphere; it was almost as
exciting as stealing pears. She looked at him with
sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you try?” she asked daringly, and felt
a tremulous hope that he would, though she could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
believe it possible that he would calmly cross the
social Rubicon again, and make her feel that all men
were and are “of necessity free and equal.”</p>

<p>“You do not really wish me to try,” he retorted;
“to you this is an adventure, and I”—he smiled,
but a deeper emotion darkened his eyes—“I am the
dancing bear.”</p>

<p>Her cheeks reddened yet more deeply, and her
breath came quickly. What had she done? Opened
the way for a dilemma? This man would not be led;
he was a new and alarming problem. She was trying
to collect her thoughts to answer him, to put back
the old tone of trivial banter, to restore the lost
equilibrium, but happily she was spared the task.
The tempest had lulled unnoticed, while they talked,
and they were suddenly aware that the shop-door had
opened and closed again, and some one was coming
toward them. The next moment Dr. Cheyney appeared
at the threshold, and Diana sank back into
the shelter of the old chair with a feeling of infinite
relief.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HALF an hour later Caleb Trench was helping
his two guests into the doctor’s old-fashioned,
high-topped buggy.</p>

<p>“That’ll do, Caleb; I’ve got her safely tucked in,”
Dr. Cheyney said, as he gathered the reins up and
disentangled them from old Henk’s tail. “I reckon
Henk and I can carry her all right; she isn’t any
more delicate than a basket of eggs.”</p>

<p>Diana smiled in her corner of the carriage. “Thank
you again, Mr. Trench,” she said gently; “it’s nice
to have some one considerate. Dr. Cheyney has always
scolded me, and I suppose he always will.”</p>

<p>“Think likely,” the doctor twinkled; “you mostly
deserve it, Miss Royall.”</p>

<p>“He’s worse when he calls me names,” Diana
lamented, and bowed her head again to Caleb as old
Henk started deliberately upon his way.</p>

<p>The hood of the vehicle shut off her view, and she
did not know that Trench stood bareheaded in the
rain to watch the receding carriage, until the drenched
green boughs locking over the road closed his last
glimpse of it in a mist-wreathed perspective, beautiful
with wind-beaten showers of dogwood bloom.</p>

<p>The two inside the buggy were rather silent for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
while. Diana was watching the light rainfall. The
sun was breaking through the clouds, and the atmosphere
became wonderfully translucent. Great
branches were strewn by the way, and a tall pine,
cleft from tip to root, showed the course of a thunderbolt.
The stream was so swollen that old Henk
forded with cautious feet, and the water lapped
above the carriage step.</p>

<p>“Drowned out most of the young crops,” Dr.
Cheyney remarked laconically.</p>

<p>“What sort of a man is Caleb Trench?” Diana
asked irrelevantly.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney looked around at her with quizzical
eyes. “A shopkeeper,” he replied. “I reckon that’s
about as far as you got before to-day, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>She colored. “I suppose it was,” she admitted,
and then added, “Not quite, doctor; I saw that he
was odd.”</p>

<p>The old man smiled. “Di,” he said, “when you
were no higher than my knee you’d have been more
truthful. You know, as well as I do, that the man is
above the average; he’s keeping shop and reading
law down at Judge Hollis’ office, and he’s trying to
teach the backwoodsmen honest politics. Taken out
a pretty large contract, eh?”</p>

<p>Diana looked down at her fine strong hands lying
crossed in her lap; her face was deeply thoughtful.
“I suppose he’s bent on rising in politics,” she said,
with a touch of scorn in her voice; “the typical self-made
man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“You didn’t happen to know that he was a gentleman,”
Dr. Cheyney remarked dryly.</p>

<p>She met his eye and smiled unwillingly. “I did,”
she said; “I saw it—to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you did, did you?” The old man slapped
Henk with the reins. “Well, what else did you see?”</p>

<p>“Very little, I imagine,” she replied. “I suppose I
thought he had ‘a story’; that’s the common thing,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” admitted the doctor, “but it isn’t so,
as far as I know. Caleb Trench comes of good old
stock in Pennsylvania. His father lost a fortune
just before Caleb left college; the old man’s dead,
and his wife, too. Trench has had to work and work
hard. He couldn’t take his law course, and he’s
never complained. He got together a little money
and had to pay it all out for his sister; she was
dying of some spinal trouble, and had to be nursed
through a long illness and buried. Trench gave every
cent; now he’s making a new start. Hollis likes
him, so does Miss Sarah.”</p>

<p>Diana smiled. “It’s something to please Miss
Sarah.”</p>

<p>“I never did,” said William Cheyney calmly; “she
declares I tried to poison her last time she was laid up
with sciatica. She’s taking patent medicines now,
and when she’s at the last gasp she’ll send for me
and lay the blame on my shoulders.”</p>

<p>“It’s hard to be a doctor after all, isn’t it?”
laughed Diana; then she leaned forward and caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
the blossoming end of a vagrant dogwood and broke
off the flowers as they passed. “Dr. Cheyney,” she
went on, after a long moment, “I’ve wanted you to
see father again; I don’t believe he’s well.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked the doctor, his eyes on the
mist of rain that seemed to move before them like
the pillar of cloud before the Israelites.</p>

<p>“He’s moody,” she said, “he’s almost sad at
times and—and he spent an hour in the Shut
Room—” She paused and looked questioningly at
the old man beside her, but he made no comment.</p>

<p>In the pause they heard the slush of Henk’s hoofs
in the muddy road.</p>

<p>“I wish he wouldn’t,” Diana continued; “it’s
beautiful—his devotion to my mother’s memory,
but I—I’m jealous of that Shut Room, it makes
him so unhappy. Couldn’t I break it up by taking
him away?”</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head. “Better not, Diana,”
he cautioned her, “better not. You can’t uproot an
old tree. Let him fight his battle out alone.”</p>

<p>“I can’t bear that he should be alone,” she protested
tenderly. “I can’t bear to be shut out even
from his griefs. Pa and I are all in all to each
other. Why does he never speak of mother? Is
it his sorrow?”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney nodded, pursing his lips. Henk
jogged on.</p>

<p>“It’s a long time,” said Diana, “I was only three
years old.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“Let it be, my girl,” the old man counseled; “we
can’t enter the upper chamber of the soul, you know.
David’s got to fight it out. Sometimes”—the
doctor let the reins go so slack that old Henk walked—“sometimes
grief is like a raw cut, Diana, and we
can’t put in a few stitches either; got to leave that
to Providence.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t well,” Diana insisted.</p>

<p>“He’d be no better for my meddling,” Dr. Cheyney
retorted, unmoved.</p>

<p>“I wanted him to go East with me,” she continued,
“to go to New York.”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney glanced up quickly. “And he
wouldn’t?”</p>

<p>Diana shook her head.</p>

<p>“Don’t you ask it,” cautioned the old man. “It’s
the time of year when your father’s full of notions;
let him be.”</p>

<p>“The time of year”—Diana met the doctor’s
kindly eyes—“when mother died?”</p>

<p>William Cheyney turned red. The girl, looking at
him, saw the dull red stealing up to the old man’s
white hair and wondered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said.</p>

<p>“Do I look like her?” Diana asked, after a moment
of perplexed thought.</p>

<p>“No!” said Dr. Cheyney shortly.</p>

<p>Old Henk had climbed the last hill,—the one that
always seems to meet the sky until you have climbed
it,—and there, below it, unfolded the wide valley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
with the brown of new-plowed fields and the long
strips of lovely foliage. The mist of the rain was
molten gold now, and a rainbow spanned the sky.</p>

<p>“I wish I did!” Diana sighed regretfully.</p>

<p>“You’re the handsomest woman in the State,”
the old doctor retorted tartly. “What more do you
want?”</p>

<p>“The kingdoms of earth,” replied Diana, and
laughed softly.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney disentangled the rein again from
old Henk’s tail, and they turned the corner.</p>

<p>“Diana,” he said abruptly, “did you happen to
ask Caleb Trench to call?”</p>

<p>“I?” Diana flushed crimson. “No,” she said reluctantly,
“I didn’t.”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney shook with silent laughter. “That’s
the way you treat the good Samaritan,” he said.
“I’d rather be the Levite, Di.”</p>

<p>She leaned back in her corner of the carriage,
blushing but resentful, a line between her brows. “It
wouldn’t be any use,” she said. “I—I couldn’t
make him feel welcome there.”</p>

<p>“You mean that Cousin Jacob would insult him,”
Dr. Cheyney said bluntly.</p>

<p>She stiffened. “I should protect my own guests,”
she retorted hotly.</p>

<p>“Could you?” asked the doctor dryly.</p>

<p>Diana met his eyes indignantly; then a throb of
pain in her ankle made her wince.</p>

<p>“I reckon it does hurt, Di.” The old man smiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
compassionately. “I’ll bandage it when we get you
home. Don’t be capering off your horse again in
thunder-storms.”</p>

<p>“I’d be sure to break my neck next time, I suppose,”
she said ruefully.</p>

<p>“Let it be a leg, Di,” advised the doctor, “that
would give me a job; the other would all go to the
undertaker. He told me once,” he added, with a
twinkle, “that we worked so much together we ought
to have a common interest. I believe he wanted to
found a trust—‘doctors’ and undertakers’ amalgamated
protected’—or something of that sort. I
begged off on the ground of injury to my profession.
I told him it wouldn’t do for a poor man like me to
go into a trust with a rich planter.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Cheyney,” Diana interrupted, “I don’t want
you to think that Jacob Eaton rules our house; he
has more influence with father than I wish he had,
but he can’t rule father.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll marry him in the end,” William
Cheyney remarked reflectively.</p>

<p>Diana, leaning back in her corner, looked thoughtful.
“No,” she said slowly, “I don’t believe I
will.”</p>

<p>The doctor slapped Henk again with his loose rein.
“Why not?” he asked dispassionately.</p>

<p>She thought a moment, a gleam of mischief deepening
in her glance. “For one thing, his eyes are too
near together,” she said at last.</p>

<p>“There’s no telling but what you could get them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
spaced better,” he replied, twinkling; “science is
advancing, and so is wireless telegraphy.”</p>

<p>Diana laughed. “Some one will like them as they
are,” she said, “and Jacob thinks them handsome.”</p>

<p>“Sleek young cub!” said the doctor, turning in at
the gate that led to the old white house with its two
wings and its belvedere. “I’d like you to marry a
real man, Di.”</p>

<p>Diana leaned her head back in the corner and
closed her eyes, as the throbbing pain held her breathless
again. Then she smiled. “Dr. Cheyney,” she
said, “do you remember the time I cried because you
wouldn’t give me the pink capsules?”</p>

<p>“You were seven,” replied the doctor placidly.
“I remember. They would have killed you, but
you screamed for them; you raised Cain about
them.”</p>

<p>“I wanted my own way,” said Diana, “and I
want it still. I think I’d better be an old maid.”</p>

<p>Old Henk was jogging up the path, and before the
doctor could reply a negro stableman came running
breathless, and stopped at the sight of Diana.</p>

<p>“Fo’ de Lawd, Miss Di!” he said, “I’se glad ter
see you. Jerry done come home drenched, an’ we ’se
been out searchin’—scared ter tell de col’nel.”</p>

<p>“You old rogue!” said the doctor, “he was the
first one to tell. Miss Diana has sprained her ankle.”</p>

<p>“He was right,” said Diana promptly; “father
would have been out in the storm and never found
me. Texas, go on up and tell the colonel that I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
hurt my ankle; I won’t have him worried, and I
can’t walk well enough to deceive him.”</p>

<p>The doctor looked at her quizzically. “That’s
right, Di,” he said, driving on; “you’ve spoilt him,
but I reckon he can stand it if I can.”</p>

<p>“He began it,” she laughed softly; “he spoilt me
first.”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney laughed too. “Perhaps he did,” he
admitted gently,—“perhaps he did, but I’m not
sure; you’ve got to have your trial, Diana.”</p>

<p>They were at the door now, and she laid her hand
suddenly over the old man’s. “Dr. Cheyney,” she
said, “won’t you thank Caleb Trench and tell him
I’d be glad to have him come up here? I want to
thank him again properly.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Dr. Cheyney promptly, “I won’t.”</p>

<p>Diana’s eyes opened. “Why?” she demanded,
flushing hotly, half indignant.</p>

<p>The doctor looked over the top of his spectacles.
“He wouldn’t come, Diana,” he said; “you wouldn’t
either, in his place.”</p>

<p>She did not answer, but turned away abruptly and
reached out both hands to Texas, who helped her
down. “Good-bye, doctor,” she said coolly, standing
with one hand on the negro’s shoulder.</p>

<p>The doctor climbed out. “Go to!” he said, smiling
grimly; “I’m coming in to bandage your ankle.
Don’t cry for the pink capsules again, Di.”</p>

<p>And Diana turned crimson with anger.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the weeks that followed, while Diana nursed
her sprained ankle in enforced retirement,
changes were taking place at the Cross-Roads.
Caleb Trench did not close his little shop, but he put
out the new sign: “Caleb Trench, Attorney-at-law.”</p>

<p>The little rear room, into which he had carried
Diana, was converted into an office, with a new table
and another bookcase. Shot, the yellow mongrel,
moved from the rear door to the front, and the great
metamorphosis was complete. If we could only
change our souls as easily as we do our surroundings,
how magnificent would be the opportunities of life!</p>

<p>Caleb Trench had opened his law office, but as yet
he had no clients, that is, no clients who were likely
to pay him fees. The countrymen who traded with
him and knew him to be honest came by the score
to consult him about their difficulties, but they had
no thought of paying for Caleb’s friendship, and
Caleb asked them nothing. Yet his influence with
them grew by that subtle power that we call personal
magnetism, and which is, more truly, the magnetism of
vital force and sometimes of a clear unbiased mind.</p>

<p>For the most part Caleb and the dog sat together
in the office, and their friendship for each other was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
one of the natural outcomes of the master’s life. The
solitary man loved his dog, and the dog, in turn,
adored him and lay content for hours at his feet. It
was the seventh week after he had carried Diana into
his little shop, and as he sat there, by his desk, the
moving sunshine slanting across the floor of the office,
he recalled the instant when her head lay unconsciously
on his shoulder and her cheek touched his
rough coat. For one long moment his mind dwelt on
it, and dwelt on her by his fire, with the glow of it in
her eyes, her soft voice, her sweet manners, in which
there was just a suggestion of condescension, until
she forgot it and spoke to him naturally and freely.
He saw her plainly again, as plainly as he saw the
swaying boughs of the silver birch before his window.
Then he thrust the thought resolutely away and
turned almost with relief to face the shambling country
youth who had entered without knocking.</p>

<p>“Well, Zeb?” he said shortly, but not unkindly.</p>

<p>“I stopped by ter see yo’, Mr. Trench,” Zeb Bartlett
drawled slowly; “I thought mebbe yo’d help
me out.”</p>

<p>Trench glanced at him and saw that he had been
drinking. He was a lean, lank boy of nineteen, with
a weak face that gave evidence of a weaker brain,
and he bore a strong resemblance to his half-sister;
he was accounted almost an idiot by the gossips of
Eshcol, and was always in trouble, but, as he was the
only grandson of a poor old woman, he escaped his
deserts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“What do you want now, Zeb?” Trench asked
dryly, turning back to his papers; he was still studying
law with a zeal that was later to bear fruit in the
case that divided Eshcol.</p>

<p>“I want two dollahs,” Zeb said with a whine. “I
haven’t had any work fer a week, an’ Jean’s starvin’
agin. Gimme two dollahs, Mr. Trench, an’ I’ll return
it with—with interes’ on Saturday night, sho’,”
he said, triumphing at the end, and pulling off his
soft felt hat to rub his head helplessly.</p>

<p>“Not two cents,” said Caleb; “you’d get drunk.”</p>

<p>“I sure won’t!” protested Zeb, his mouth drooping
and his hands falling weakly at his sides, as if he had
suddenly lost the starch necessary to keep his lines
crisp. “I ain’t seen liquor fer a month.”</p>

<p>“What have you been drinking then?” Trench
asked, with the ghost of a smile.</p>

<p>“Water,” said Zeb, rallying, “water—ef it warn’t
fer that I’d be dry ez punk. ’Deed, Mr. Trench, I
needs money. Jean’s mighty sick.”</p>

<p>“No, she isn’t,” said Caleb. “I spoke to her at
the market this morning.”</p>

<p>Zeb’s mouth opened again, like a stranded fish, and
he stared; but he wanted the money. “She wuz
took sick after that,” he explained, brightening, “she
asked me ter git it. Gimme er dollah, Mr. Trench.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Caleb.</p>

<p>“Fifty cents,” whined Zeb, but a sullen look was
coming into his light eyes.</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>“Twenty-five cents!” pleaded the borrower,
wheedling, but with angry eyes.</p>

<p>“Not a cent; you’d spend it on whiskey,” Caleb
said.</p>

<p>Zeb’s face changed, the cringing attitude of a
seeker of a favor fell from him, he snarled. “You’re
a low-down, mean, sniveling shopkeeper!” he began.
“I believe Jean’s tellin’ on yo’, sure enough, I—”</p>

<p>Caleb rose from his seat, his great figure towering
over the drunkard, as he took him by the collar
and thrust him out the door. “Go home,” he said,
“and don’t you ever come here again!”</p>

<p>Zeb fell out of his hand and shambled up against
the silver birch, sputtering. He hated Trench, but
he was afraid to give voice to his wrath. Besides,
Shot was between them now, every hair erect on the
ridge of his spine. Zeb shook his fist and trembled.</p>

<p>“Go home,” said Trench again, and then to the dog,
“Come, Shot!” and he turned back contemptuously.</p>

<p>As he did so, a tall farmer in brown homespun, with
a wide-brimmed straw hat, drove up in his light
wagon and got down to speak to him. The newcomer’s
eyes fell on Zeb. “Drunk again,” he remarked.</p>

<p>Trench nodded, and the two went into the office.</p>

<p>Zeb Bartlett sank down under the trees and wept;
he was just far enough gone to dissolve with self-pity.
He believed Trench to be a monster who owed
him two dollars for his very existence. He sat under
the silver birch and babbled and shook his fist. Then
his thirst overcame him, and he gathered himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
together again and shambled down the road toward
the nearest public house. He usually earned his
drinks by scrubbing the floors, but this morning he
had not felt like scrubbing and, because scrub he
must, he hated Caleb Trench yet more, and turned
once in the road to shake his fist and weep.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Trench was going patiently through
the papers of his new visitor, Aaron Todd. The
stout mountaineer owned timberlands, had a sawmill
and grew corn on his fertile lower meadows for
the city markets. Todd was considered rich, and his
money was sought for new investments. The get-rich-quick
machines thrive upon the outlying districts.
Todd had been asked to put more money in
the Eaton Land Company; he had some there already
and was suddenly smitten with a caution that
sent him to Caleb. The lawyer was new, but the
clear brain of the shopkeeper had been tested. Todd
knew him, and watched as he turned the papers over
and read the glowing circular of the Land Company,
its capital, its stock and its declared dividends. It
was alluring and high sounding, a gilt-edged affair.</p>

<p>Trench looked up from the long perusal, the perpendicular
line between his brows sharp as a scar.
“Are you all in?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Todd shook his head. “No,” he said tersely,
“about five thousand. I could put in ten, but that
would strip me down to the ground. The interest’s
large and I need it if I’m to run that sawmill another
year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“Don’t do it,” said Trench.</p>

<p>As Todd took back the papers and strapped them
together with an India-rubber band, his face was
thoughtful. “Why not?” he asked at last; “you’ve
got a reason.”</p>

<p>Trench nodded.</p>

<p>Todd looked at him keenly. “Mind tellin’ it?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said Caleb, “it’s not proven, but
I’m willing to show you one objection; this scheme
is offering abnormal interest—”</p>

<p>“And paying it,” threw in Todd.</p>

<p>“And paying it now,” admitted Trench, “but for
how long? Why can they pay ten per cent when the
others only pay four and a half? I’d put my money
in the four and a half per cent concerns and feel safe.
When a firm offers such an inducement, it’s not
apt to be sound; it isn’t legitimate business, as I
see it.”</p>

<p>Todd put the papers slowly back into his pocket.
“Mebbe you’re right,” he admitted, “but they’re
all in it; I reckon the whole East Mountain district’s
in it, an’ half of Eshcol. They say it’s Jacob Eaton’s.”</p>

<p>Trench strummed lightly on the desk with his
fingers. “So they say,” he assented without emotion.</p>

<p>Todd ruminated, cutting off a piece of tobacco.
“Eaton’s bent on lickin’ Yarnall out of the nomination,
an’ we don’t want Aylett again. I believe I’ll
take to your ticket,” he remarked.</p>

<p>Trench looked at him, and his full regard had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
singularly disconcerting effect; Diana herself had felt
it. “Vote for Peter Mahan,” he said coolly.</p>

<p>“See here, Trench,” said Todd abruptly, “I believe
you’d make a man vote for the devil if you
looked at him like that!”</p>

<p>Caleb laughed, and his laugh was as winning as
his smile; both were rare. “I’m only suggesting
Mahan,” he said.</p>

<p>“We’ve never had a Republican, not since five
years before the war. That was before I was born,”
Todd replied. “It would sweep out every office-holder
in the State, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your civil service?” asked Trench
dryly.</p>

<p>“It’s rotten,” said Todd. “There ain’t a man in
now that ain’t an Eaton or an Aylett runner. I’d a
damned sight rather hunt a flea in a feather-bed than
try to catch Jacob Eaton when he’s dodging in
politics.”</p>

<p>“Yet Mr. Eaton has you all in the hollow of his
hand,” said Trench. “You don’t like his methods;
you’re all the time reviling his politics, but there
isn’t a man among you that dares vote the Republican
ticket. It’s not his fault if he is your boss.”</p>

<p>Todd rubbed the back of his head. “There’s a
pesky lot of truth in that,” he admitted reluctantly,
“but—well, see here, Mr. Trench, about three
quarters of the county’s his, anyway, and the rest of
it belongs to men who’ve invested with him an’
they’re afraid to run against him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“This Land Company seems to be about the biggest
political engine he has,” Caleb remarked. “Twenty-nine
out of every thirty tell me the same story. Practically,
then, Mr. Eaton hasn’t bought you, but he’s
got your money all in his control, you elect his underlings
and through them he governs you, speculates
with your money, and, in time, you’ll send him to
the United States Senate. As a matter of fact, if
the same system worked in the other States, he could
be President.”</p>

<p>“By George, so he could! I hadn’t thought of it,”
said Todd, letting his heavy fist fall on the table with
a force that made every article on it dance. “Mr.
Trench, I want you to put that before the people up
to Cresset’s Corners. There’s going to be a town
meeting there on Friday night. If you’ll let me,
I’ll post it in the post-office that you’ll speak on the
Republican ticket. You can just drop this in as you
go along.”</p>

<p>Caleb thought hard, drawing a line on the table
with his paper-cutter. “I’m perfectly willing to
speak for the Republican ticket,” he said, amused,
“but this is not germane to that subject. If they ask
questions I’ll answer them, but I wouldn’t start out
to attack Mr. Eaton personally without grounds.
I’ve said all I want to say here and now; of course
I’ll say it over again in public, but I can’t throw
Mr. Eaton’s method into the Republican ticket.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask all the questions,” said Todd. “What I
want is, to get the facts out. Everybody’s for Eaton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
because everybody’s scairt, an’ really Yarnall’s the
best man we’ve got.”</p>

<p>“Then vote for Yarnall,” Trench advised coolly.</p>

<p>“He ain’t Republican, an’ you want the Republican
ticket,” protested Todd, a little bewildered.</p>

<p>“We can’t elect it,” said Caleb; “even with the
Democratic Party split, we can’t get votes enough.
If you’re a Democrat vote for Yarnall.”</p>

<p>Todd folded his tobacco pouch and thrust it into
his trousers’ pocket, with burrowing thoughtfulness,
then he pulled the crease out of his waistcoat. “How
many have you said that to?” he asked.</p>

<p>Trench smiled. “To every man who has asked me,”
he replied, “the Republican ticket first and Yarnall
next.”</p>

<p>Todd rose and picked up his broad hat. “I reckon
we’ll have Yarnall after all,” he drawled, “but you’ll
speak Friday, Trench?”</p>

<p>Trench nodded.</p>

<p>Just then some one came into the shop with the
frou-frou of ruffled skirts. Caleb went out, followed
by Shot first and Todd last. Shot greeted the newcomer
with uplifted paw. Miss Kitty Broughton
bowed and shook hands with the dog, laughing;
she was very pretty, and in a flowered muslin, with
a broad-brimmed saucy straw, she looked the incarnation
of spring. No one would have imagined that
she was a granddaughter of old Judge Hollis and a
grandniece of Miss Sarah.</p>

<p>She went up to the counter and pushed a square<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
white envelope across to Caleb. Meanwhile, Aaron
Todd had gone out to his wagon and was climbing
into it. Trench took the envelope, smiling back into
Miss Kitty’s laughing blue eyes, and opened it.</p>

<p>“So you’re ‘out,’ are you, Miss Broughton?” he
asked, “or is this only the first alarm?”</p>

<p>“It’s my first really and truly ball,” said Kitty,
“and Aunt Sarah’s going to lead the Virginia Reel!”
She clapped her hands delightedly. “You’ll come,
Mr. Trench?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t been to a ball in six years,” replied
Caleb, smiling, “I wouldn’t know a soul. You’re
good to me, Miss Broughton, and I’ll send a bouquet.”</p>

<p>“You’ll come!” said Kitty.</p>

<p>He shook his head, still smiling. “Shot would be
better fun,” he said; “you mustn’t invite shopkeepers,
Miss Kitty.”</p>

<p>Kitty pouted, but a red streak went up to her hair.
She knew she would be teased by her intimates later
for that very thing. Yet Caleb was a gentleman, and
Judge Hollis loved him; Kitty was not sure that she
could not love him herself if he tried to make her,
but he never did, and he looked as detached now as a
pyramid of Egypt, which was a nettle to her vanity.</p>

<p>“Will you come?” she demanded, leaning on the
counter and nestling her little round chin into the
hollow of her hands. Something in the gesture made
him think of Diana—if Kitty had but known it!</p>

<p>“Can’t you let me off?” he asked good-naturedly.</p>

<p>She shook her head. “Please come,” she said. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
bet Judge Hollis a dollar that I’d make you—and
I’ll have to go without my dollar if you refuse; he
swore you would.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you let me pay the debt, Miss Kitty?”
Caleb smiled.</p>

<p>She shook her head. “Oh, it’s more than the
money,” she protested. “He’ll say I couldn’t get
you to come. I’ve got some pride about it; I hate
to be laughed at.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” sympathized Trench, “and they’ll
laugh at me for going. They’ll call me the Yankee
shopkeeper—but I’ll go.”</p>

<p>She clapped her hands delightedly. “Really?
Honor bright?”</p>

<p>“Honor bright,” he affirmed; “will you dance with
me, Miss Broughton?”</p>

<p>“The very first dance,” laughed Kitty. “You’re
the captive of my bow and spear. You’ll be angry,
too, for everybody wants to dance first with Diana
Royall. She’s the belle, and her sprained ankle’s
well again. Was it true that you carried her in out of
the rain?” she asked curiously, her blue eyes dancing.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you gossiped,” parried Trench.</p>

<p>“Oh, I love it!” she protested, “and Diana won’t
tell me. It sounds so romantic, too. I’ll know,
though—because you’ll ask her to dance next if
you did.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you will know,” said Caleb.</p>

<p>She looked across the counter at him, her head on
one side. “Why won’t you tell me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>“Ask Miss Royall,” he suggested quietly.</p>

<p>“I know it’s true now!” Kitty cried.</p>

<p>“Go home and mind your own business, you minx!”
said Judge Hollis, suddenly appearing, his large figure
filling the door. “Don’t let her waste your time,
Caleb,—the idlest little girl in the county.”</p>

<p>“I’ve won my dollar!” cried Kitty, presenting an
ungloved little hand, the pink palm up; “pay your
debts, sir.”</p>

<p>The judge laughed and drew out a silver dollar.
“Are you going, Caleb?” he asked. “I won’t pay
till I’m certain; the baggage fleeces me.”</p>

<p>“I’ve promised,” said Caleb, smiling; “she’s
fairly earned it, Judge.”</p>

<p>“There it is, miss,” said the judge and kissed her.
“Now go home!”</p>

<p>Kitty laughed. “I can’t,” she said, “I’ve got a
dollar more to spend at Eshcol. I’m going into
town. Good-bye, and be sure you come, Mr. Trench.”</p>

<p>“He will,” said the judge firmly, “or you’ll refund
that dollar.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go, Miss Broughton,” Caleb said, though in
his heart he dreaded it; he had a proud man’s aversion
to meeting discourtesy from those who despised
his poverty, and he had observed the red when it
stained Kitty’s cheek. But, after all, it was a small
matter, he reflected; to one of Caleb’s habits of
thought the social part of life was a small matter.
Yet it is the small things which prick until the blood
comes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A WEEK from that day Caleb Trench addressed
a crowd of backwoodsmen and some
of the Eshcol farmers at the town hall at
Cresset’s Corners. Even if a reporter had not been
there, it would have passed by word of mouth all
over the county, and, later, through the State.</p>

<p>There are moments when the eloquence of man
consists in telling the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth. The fact that the countrymen
had not heard it for nearly fifteen years clothed
it with spell-binding powers. For half an hour Caleb
Trench talked to them with extraordinary simplicity
and directness; when he had finished they knew how
they were governed and why. He had the power of
making his argument clear to the humblest, and yet
convincing to the most learned, which is the power
that men call persuasion. In that half-hour they found
that they had raised up the Golden Calf themselves,
and that it had smitten them. Jacob Eaton suddenly
appeared like a huge spider whose golden web had
immeshed the entire State, while they themselves
were hung in it like wounded flies. Yet, yesterday,
Jacob Eaton had been a young man of fine family
and immense influence. That night they went home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
disputing and lay awake, in the agonies of reflection,
trying to find a way to withdraw themselves from his
investments; that they could not find it involved
them in still deeper distress. All this while, the
figure of Caleb Trench began to stand out sharply
and suddenly, like the silhouette thrown on the sheet
by the lamp of the stereopticon.</p>

<p>He made no effort to keep himself before them;
having told them the truth, he acted as if he had performed
his mission and went about his own business,
which was chiefly, just then, keeping shop and reading
law only at night. The summer trade was on, the
roads were good, and customers more plentiful than
clients.</p>

<p>Thursday night was the date of Kitty Broughton’s
ball; Wednesday, of the previous week, brought Caleb
his first client. The two events afterwards fixed many
things in his memory, for at this time he was trying
to forget that Miss Royall had ever sat in his old armchair
by the stove. The peculiarly haunting qualities
of some individuals, who are not spooks, is past explanation.
Caleb felt that there was no more pricking
misery than to see eternally one face and one figure
in his favorite chair, when neither of them could ever
possibly belong there, and it was to his interest to forget
them. There should be, by the way, a method
for exorcising such ghosts and compelling their rightful
owners to keep them labeled in a locked cabinet
instead of projecting them upon the innocent and the
defenseless. Caleb’s method consisted, at present, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
turning the old chair upside down in the closet back
of the kitchen, which ought to have discouraged any
self-respecting ghost, yet Wednesday morning he got
it out again and put it reverently in its place, with a
sheepish feeling of having committed a crime in trying
to dishonor it.</p>

<p>It was after the ceremony of restoration that
Juniper arrived with a long face. He had been temporarily
reconciled to Aunt Charity and was shouldering
her chief responsibility, her son Lysander.</p>

<p>“De jedge, he sent me down ter see yo’, suh,”
Juniper explained, twisting his battered hat as usual.
“I’se in a po’erful lot ob trouble an’ so ez de ole
woman.”</p>

<p>Caleb moved a little impatiently. “The silver teapot?”
he asked dryly.</p>

<p>“No,” said Juniper, without embarrassment, “no,
suh; de folks up ter de Corners ez gwine ter hab
Lysander ’rested. I reckon dey hez had him ’rested
a’ready. Dey says he dun stole der chickens on
Monday. Et wuz de dark ob de moon, suh, an’ dat
make it seem ez if dey got er case. De jedge, he
tole me ter come ter yo’.”</p>

<p>Caleb felt that Judge Hollis was enjoying his first
case. He almost heard the shouts of Homeric laughter
from that inner office. “You’ll have to prove that
he didn’t steal the chickens,” he said. “In the first
place, who are the people?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Todd’s folks,” Juniper replied, “an’ dey ses
et wuz two pullets an’ er cockerel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>Trench knew where Aaron Todd lived and recalled,
less vividly, the presence of a large chicken-yard.
“How do they suppose he could have carried them
off undiscovered, even at night?” Caleb argued. “If
I remember where the chicken-yard is, you could hear
a commotion among the fowls at any time, particularly
at night. It will be a simple matter, Juniper,
when we prove an alibi.”</p>

<p>Juniper rubbed the back of his head thoughtfully.
“Dat’s so, suh,” he replied; “I ’low dat I don’
wanter pay his fine, an’ Charity, she don’; she sho’
won’t pay et bekase she say I oughter, an’ ef Lysander
goes up fo’ sixty days an’ works on de roads, he ain’t
gwine ter do anodder stroke all de year; dat’s Lysander;
I knows ’im.”</p>

<p>“What time do they say the chickens were stolen?”</p>

<p>“Monday mawnin’, ’bout two o’clock.” Uncle Juniper
rubbed his sleeve thoughtfully across his forehead.</p>

<p>“Then we must prove an alibi,” said Caleb, swinging
around in his chair to view his client more directly.
“The point is clear; where was Lysander at two
o’clock Monday morning?”</p>

<p>“I specks he wus up dar, suh,” said Juniper cheerfully.
“He ain’t let on ter me dat he wuz anywhere
else.”</p>

<p>Caleb got up abruptly and threw open the door
into the shop; he had seen Colonel Royall coming.
Then he dashed off a note to Aaron Todd, enclosing
a cheque for the two pullets and the cockerel, and
gave it to Juniper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“Take that up to the Corners,” he said briefly,
“and I think Lysander will get off without arrest,
but tell him if he steals any more I’ll thrash him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” said Juniper, expectant but unbelieving.</p>

<p>Later, however, when Todd took the money and let
Lysander off, he was convinced, and, like all new converts,
he became a zealot, and went about telling of
the miracles wrought by the new lawyer. Thus did
Caleb’s fame go abroad in the byways and alleys,
which is, after all, the road to celebrity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Colonel Royall, very inconsiderately,
sat in Diana’s chair. He had heard of the speech at
Cresset’s Corners, and knew that Trench was supporting
Yarnall for the Democratic nomination. Yet the
colonel admired Trench, the force of whose convictions
was already bearing fruit.</p>

<p>Eight weeks before, Colonel Royall had made a
formal call on Caleb to thank him for his courtesy
and service to Diana. He was a Southern gentleman
of the old school, and he had done it without allowing
even a drop of condescension in his manner. Moreover,
he liked Trench and was trying to put together
the modesty of the man, who had colored at his acknowledgments,
with the incendiary ability that
could rouse and hold a meeting of backwoodsmen on
a subject that was as foreign to their understanding
as it was alarming. Admitted, for the first time, into
the inner office, the colonel gazed about with almost
as much curiosity as Diana, and he drew conclusions
not unlike hers, but more pregnant with the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>The colonel’s own face in repose was infinitely sad,
yet when he spoke and laughed his expression was
almost happy. But he had been twenty years turning
the key on his inner self, and the result was an
exterior that reminded an observer of an alabaster
chalice in which the throbbing pulse of life lay clasped
and all but crystallized. His face in repose had almost
the sweetness of a woman’s, and only when the blue
eyes blazed with sudden wrath was there ever cause
to fear him. That he was a dreamer of dreams was
apparent at a glance; that he could keep an unhappy
secret twenty years seemed more improbable. He
leaned back in his chair, clasping his hands on top of
the stout hickory stick he carried.</p>

<p>“Mr. Trench,” he said slowly, with his Southern
drawl, “I congratulate you on your success in
politics.”</p>

<p>Caleb turned red. He was aware of the universal
prejudice against his politics in Colonel Royall’s class.
“Thank you, Colonel,” he said formally, rising to
look for glasses in his cupboard. “I can’t offer you
fine old wine, sir, but I have some Kentucky whiskey
that Judge Hollis sent me.”</p>

<p>“After the speech at Cresset’s?” The corners of
the colonel’s mouth twitched.</p>

<p>Caleb poured out the whiskey and handed the glass
to his guest. “You know the judge well, sir,” he remarked,
and his composure under the jest won upon
the colonel.</p>

<p>He tasted the whiskey with the air of a connoisseur.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
“In Virginia, Mr. Trench, we should make this into
juleps,” he said appreciatively; “the judge was raised
in the Kentucky mountains and he knows a good thing
when he sees it. I read the report of your speech, sir,
and I admired it, but”—the colonel let his hand fall
a little heavily on the arm of the chair where Diana’s
elbow had rested,—he little knew the enormity of
his action—“if I thought it was all true I should
have to change my coat. I don’t—but I believe
you do.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Trench quietly, “I do.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” said Colonel Royall; “then you
did right, but you’ve made more enemies than you
could shake a stick at. Jacob Eaton’s my cousin, a
young man yet, but mighty clever, and I reckon he’ll
remember all you said. There isn’t any call for me
to resent things for Jacob! No, sir, I honor you for
your courage, if those are your convictions, but
Yarnall can’t be elected here.”</p>

<p>“I think he can, Colonel,” Caleb replied, unmoved.
The lines about his mouth straightened a
little and there was a glint in his gray eyes; otherwise
his composure was unruffled.</p>

<p>Colonel Royall set down his empty glass and
waved aside the proffered bottle. “No more, sir,
it’s too good to be safe; like most fine things, a little
goes a long way. What makes you think you can
nominate Yarnall? Of course you can’t elect a Republican,
so I see your point in trying to influence
the Democrats. By gum, sir, it’s the first time it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
been attempted, and it’s knocked the organization
into splinters; they’re standing around waiting to see
what you’ll do next!” The colonel laughed softly.</p>

<p>“They’ll nominate Yarnall and they’ll elect him,”
said Caleb; “Aylett can’t get two votes out of ten.
I’m sorry to go against your candidate, Colonel,”
he added, smiling.</p>

<p>“Eh?” said the colonel; he was, in fact, suddenly
aware of the charm of Caleb’s rare smile. He had
not known that the man could smile like that.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I appear an interloper in a fenced, no-trespass
field,” Caleb continued pleasantly. “I’m
a Republican, of course, and”—his eyes twinkled—“something
of a Yankee, but, as we can’t elect a
Republican, you must forgive me for choosing the
less instead of the greater evil.”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall picked up his broad-brimmed
Panama and twirled it thoughtfully on the top of
his stick. “What’s your objection to Aylett?” he
asked meditatively.</p>

<p>Trench was momentarily embarrassed, then he
plunged boldly. “In the parlance, we would call
him a machine man,” he said; “he was elected by
the same system that has ruled this State for years;
he’s bound hand and foot to it, and his reëlection
means—a continuance of the present conditions.”</p>

<p>It was now Colonel Royall’s turn to smile. “You
mean a continuance of Jacob Eaton? Well, I expect
it will, and I don’t know but what it’s a good thing.
You haven’t converted me to your heresy, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
Trench, but I’ve tasted of your hospitality, and if
you don’t come and taste mine I’ll feel it a disgrace.
Why have you not come to see me, sir? I asked you
when I came here to acknowledge your courtesy to
my daughter.”</p>

<p>Trench reddened again. “I’m coming, Colonel,”
he said at once, “but”—he hesitated—“are you
sure that a man of my political faith will be entirely
welcome?”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall straightened himself. “Sir, Mr.
Eaton does not choose my guests. I appreciate your
feeling and understand it. I shall be happy, sir, to
see you next Sunday afternoon,” and he bowed
formally, having risen to his full height.</p>

<p>Caleb took his proffered hand heartily, and walked
with him to the door. Yet he did not altogether
relish the thought of a call at Broad Acres; he remembered
too vividly his visit there to refund Diana’s
money, and reddened at the thought of a certain receipt
which he still carried in his pocket. He had
set out to restore her change because he did not
wish her to think she had been overcharged, and
it was not until he had fairly embarked upon the interview
that he had regretted not sending it by mail,
and had reached a point where stealing it would
have seemed a virtue! The fact that the Broad
Acres people seldom, if ever, came to his shop had
made its return in the natural course of events doubtful,
and the matter had seemed to him simple and
direct until Diana met it. The Quaker in him received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
its first shock that night, and he recoiled
from giving them another opportunity to mortify
his pride. Before that he had regarded Miss Royall
as supremely and graciously beautiful; since then
he had realized that she could be both thoughtless
and cruel.</p>

<p>He stood in his door watching the old colonel’s
erect figure walking up the long road under the
shadow of the great trees that lined it at intervals.
There was something at once stately and appealing
in the old man’s aspect, yet there was power in his
eyes and the pose of his white head. He reminded
Caleb of an old lion, sorely stricken but magnificent;
some wound had gone deep. As yet the younger
man had no notion of it; when he did know he marveled
much at the strange mingling of knight-errantry
and tenderness in the breast of one of
Nature’s noblemen. As it was, he was supremely
conscious that he liked Colonel Royall and that
Colonel Royall liked him, but that the colonel was
vividly aware that the shopkeeper at the Cross-Roads
was not his social equal; Caleb wondered bitterly
if he went further, and considered that the
gentleman of good blood and breeding was his equal
when in law and politics?</p>

<p>He turned from the door with a whimsical smile
and patted his dog’s uplifted head; then, as his eyes
lighted on the worn leather chair in which the colonel
had just sat, he turned it abruptly to the wall.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BEFORE Sunday Caleb’s settlement of his first
case was celebrated in Eshcol. Judge Hollis
got the facts from Juniper and spread the
story abroad. It was too good to keep. The cockerel
was valued at three dollars, being rare, and the pullets
cost seventy-five cents each. The attorney for
the defendant had paid the costs without pleading
the case at the bar.</p>

<p>The judge asked if he intended to settle all difficulties
on the same plane? If so, he could send him
enough clients to form a line down the Mississippi
from St. Louis to New Orleans. Juniper was telling
it too, without grasping the judge’s point of view.
As a lawyer, Juniper claimed that Caleb Trench
could out-Herod Herod. He protested that the mere
paying for the fowls had saved Lysander from being
tarred and feathered; for Aaron Todd’s indignant
threats were magnified by memory, and no one but
Mr. Trench would have thought of so simple and
efficacious a remedy.</p>

<p>The settlement of Lysander’s difficulties coming
after the famed Cresset speech created a sensation
between wrath and merriment among Caleb’s political
opponents. What manner of man was he? Caleb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
Trench, Quaker, posted on his door might have explained
him to some, but to the majority it would
have remained Greek. Besides, Caleb was not orthodox;
he had always leaned to his mother’s religion,
and she had been an Episcopalian; between the two
creeds he had found no middle course, but he had a
profound respect for the faith that brought Diana
to her knees with the simplicity of a child in the little
old gray stone church where the new curate had installed
a boy choir.</p>

<p>It was long past church time, and after the early
Sunday dinner, when he sat on the porch with Colonel
Royall at Broad Acres. The colonel was a delightful
host, and this time he did not discuss politics; he
talked, instead, about his father’s plantation in Virginia
before the war, a subject as safe as the Satires
of Horace, yet Trench fidgeted a little in his chair.
He was conscious that Diana was passing through
the hall behind him, and that, after her first correctly
courteous greeting, she had avoided the piazza.
He was, in fact, distinctly the colonel’s guest.</p>

<p>Diana was more vividly aware of social distinctions
than her father, and less forgetful of them; she
was only twenty-three, and the time was not yet
when she could forgive a man for doing anything
and everything to earn his bread. There were so
many ways, she thought, that did not embrace the
village yardstick! Besides, she rather resented the
Cresset speech. Jacob Eaton was her cousin, three
times removed it was true, but still her cousin, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
that held. Diana could not reconcile herself to the
freedom of political attacks, and Caleb Trench’s
cool, unbiased criticisms of Eaton and his methods
seemed to her to be mere personalities, and she had
gone as far as quarreling with the colonel for asking
him to call.</p>

<p>“I don’t like his attack on Jacob, pa,” she had
said hotly; “he’s no gentleman to make it!”</p>

<p>The colonel meditated, his eyes twinkling. “He’s
a good deal of a man though, Di.”</p>

<p>And Diana had turned crimson, though she did
not know why, unless she remembered suddenly her
own impression of him in his little office, when the
flare of the burning wood fell on his face. All these
things made her angry and she had received him
with an air that reminded Trench of the receipt for
six cents, yet Diana was superbly courteous. Neither
Mrs. Eaton nor Jacob appeared; they lived about
three miles away, and Mrs. Eaton had refused absolutely
to visit Cousin David on Sunday if he intended
to entertain the lower classes. She had only a very
nebulous idea of the political situation, but she
thought that Trench had vilified Jacob.</p>

<p>But with the colonel Caleb was happily at home;
even the colonel’s slow drawl was music in his ears,
and he liked the man, the repose of his manner, the
kindly glance of his sad eyes, for his eyes were sad
and tender as a woman’s. Yet Colonel Royall had
shot a man for a just cause thirty years before, and
it was known that he carried and could use his revolver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
still. The fire of the old-time gentleman
sometimes sent the quick blood up under his skin
and kindled his glance, but his slow courtesy made
him ever mindful of others. Sitting together, with
the sun slanting across the lawns and the arch of the
horse-chestnuts shadowing the driveway, Caleb told
the colonel the story of his father’s failure and, more
lightly, something of his own struggles. Then he
got down to reading law with Judge Hollis.</p>

<p>“A pretty costly business for you, sir,” the colonel
said wickedly, and then laughed until the blue veins
stood out on his forehead.</p>

<p>Caleb laughed too, but colored a little. “Juniper
is an old rogue,” he said amusedly. “I should have
bribed him to hold his tongue.”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall straightened his face and rubbed
his eyeglasses on a dollar bill, which, he held, was the
only way to clean them. “Lysander is the rogue,”
he said, “and old Aunt Charity has been known to
steal Juniper’s clothes for him to wear. She dressed
him in Juniper’s best last year and sent him to the
fair with all the money from her washing. Meanwhile
the old man had nothing but his blue jeans
and a cotton undershirt, and wanted to go to the
fair, too. There was a great row. Of course Lysander
got drunk and was sent up for thirty days in Juniper’s
Sunday clothes. Lordy!” the colonel laughed
heartily, “you could hear the noise down at the embankment.
Juniper wanted a ‘divorcement’ and his
clothes, principally his clothes. Judge Hollis and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
had to fit him out, but he and Aunt Charity didn’t
speak until there was another funeral; that brings
niggers together every time; there’s a chaste joy
about a funeral that melts their hearts.”</p>

<p>The colonel laughed again reminiscently, but
Caleb, being a young man and human, was aware
that Diana had crossed the hall again, and that she
must have heard her father laughing at him. It was
not long after this that he made his adieux, and he
did not ask to see Miss Royall. The colonel walked
with him to the gate and pointed out the magnificent
promise of grapes on his vines.</p>

<p>“It will be a plentiful season, Mr. Trench,” he
said, “and I hope a good harvest; let us have peace.”</p>

<p>Caleb understood the tentative appeal, and he
liked the old man, but to a nature like Trench’s truth
is the sling of David; he must smite Goliath. “Colonel
Royall,” he said, “no man desires peace more than I
do, but—peace with honor.”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall stood in the center of his own gateway,
his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat,
his white head bare. “Mr. Trench,” he said, “I understand
that we are not to have peace.”</p>

<p>Thursday night Kitty Broughton gave her ball.
Her father was dead, and Judge Hollis stood beside
her mother to help Kitty receive her guests. Everybody
who was anybody in the city came out, and all
Eshcol was there. Mrs. Eaton declared that it was
the most mixed affair she ever saw, when she recognized
Caleb Trench. She told all her friends not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
allow any presuming person to present him to her,
and in an hour she had made all the guests painfully
aware that there was a black sheep in the fold. Then
Kitty Broughton added fuel to the fire by dancing
the first dance with him, and it was discovered, by all
the girls present, that he danced exceedingly well,
and quite as if he had always gone to entertainments.
This surprised those who criticized Mrs. Broughton
for asking him; yet not to have had him would have
been to have the banquet without the salt. For
Jacob Eaton was there, too, and though he wore an
inscrutable face, it was exciting to wonder how he
felt, and what would happen if they met?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the dancing went on, and Mrs. Broughton
had presented Trench to several of the young
girls from the city, who admired his dancing, so he
had partners; but he was aware of the frigidity of
the atmosphere and he had not asked Miss Royall
to dance. Instead, Diana had danced twice with
her cousin and once with young Jack Cheyney, a
nephew of the doctor. She was very beautiful.
Trench looked across the ballroom at her and thought
that no sculptured figure of nymph or dryad had ever
excelled the beauty of her tall young figure, its slender
but perfect lines, and the proud pose of her head.
She wore a white brocade flowered with pink, like
apple-blossoms, and Trench thought of her and the
spring buds in his lonely office. The splendid diamond
that shone like a star above her forehead reminded
him of the wide divergence in their fates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>Judge Hollis found him and laid a fatherly hand
on his shoulder. “Glad to see you out, Caleb,” he
said heartily; “a change will do you good. Mouldy
old law-books and old men pall on a young fellow like
you. I saw you lead off with Kitty. The minx is
pretty and dances well. Have you asked Diana to
dance?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Trench; “Miss Royall has too many
partners to accept another, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“Better ask her,” counseled the judge; “the lady
is something of a tyrant. Don’t get on her black
books too early, sir; besides, courtesy demands it.
Didn’t she accept your care and hospitality?”</p>

<p>“She had to,” said Trench dryly.</p>

<p>“Precisely,” smiled the judge; “now ask her to
dance and give her the chance to say ‘no,’ then she’ll
forgive you.”</p>

<p>“I fancy there are more things to forgive than
that,” replied Caleb musingly; “Mrs. Eaton has let
me feel the weight of my social position.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy, Jinny is the biggest cad in the
world,” said the judge, drinking a glass of punch;
“go and do as I tell you or I’ll drop your acquaintance.
By the way, Caleb, how much are
cockerels now?” and the old man’s laughter drew all
eyes.</p>

<p>But it was after supper that, very much against
his determinations, Caleb found himself asking Diana
to dance. He has never known how it happened,
unless it was the compelling power of her beauty in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
the corner of the ballroom when the music began
again.</p>

<p>“May I have the honor?” he asked.</p>

<p>Diana hesitated the twentieth part of a second;
it was almost imperceptible, but it sent the blood
to the young man’s forehead. Then she smiled
graciously. “With pleasure,” she said in a clear
voice.</p>

<p>It happened that they swept past Eaton, her skirt
brushing against him, and in another moment they
were going down the old ballroom together. All eyes
followed them and returned to Jacob Eaton, who
was standing discomfited for an instant. It was only
one instant; the next Jacob was more suave and
smiling than ever, and an heiress from Lexington
danced with him. However, in that one instant, his
face had startled the groups nearest him. People
suddenly remembered that it was said that Eaton
carried firearms at all times, and was one of the
straightest shots that side of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Later, when Diana was driving home with her
father, she spoke her mind. “I wish you’d make
Jacob Eaton behave himself, pa,” she said; “he acts
as if I belonged to him and he could choose my—my
friends! I don’t like his manners up at Broad Acres,
either; he said the other day that the cold grapery
should be pulled down, and that he didn’t believe
in owning a race-horse.”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall rubbed the back of his head thoughtfully;
his eyes were troubled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“His manners are becoming insufferable,” Diana
went on, without heeding the silence.</p>

<p>“If he’s rude to you, Diana,” the colonel said
quietly, “just say so and I’ll thrash him.”</p>

<p>“I sometimes wish you would!” she retorted
wrathfully, and then, reaching up in the dim carriage,
she patted the colonel’s cheek. “You’re an old dear,”
she said fondly, “but you do get imposed on, and
Jacob never does!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DR. CHEYNEY’S old gig traveled up the hill
just behind Mrs. Eaton’s carriage, and both
turned into the gateway of Broad Acres.</p>

<p>That was the morning after Kitty Broughton’s
ball. The doctor had not been there, having had a
bad case on his hands in Eshcol, and he was full of
excitement over a new review of the Cresset speech
published in New York, in a great metropolitan daily.
It seemed that Caleb Trench was going to be celebrated
and old William Cheyney had championed
him. He had the paper in his pocket and wanted to
show it to Colonel Royall, but there was Mrs. Eaton,
and when the doctor climbed down from his high
seat she was already delivering her opinion to Diana
and her father, and she did not suppress it on account
of Dr. Cheyney.</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine what has come over you, Colonel
Royall!” that lady was saying with great indignation;
“you must be out of your senses to allow Diana
to dance in public with a common shopkeeper, a—a
kind of hoodlum, too!”</p>

<p>This was too much for Dr. Cheyney, who shook
with silent laughter; and there was a twinkle in
Colonel Royall’s eye.</p>

<p>“My dear Jinny,” he said pleasantly, “have you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
lived all these years without knowing that it’s Diana
who bosses me?”</p>

<p>“I call it a shameful exhibition,” continued Mrs.
Eaton hotly. “I never have believed in mixing the
classes—never! And to see my own cousin, and a
young girl at that, dancing with that—that fellow!
As far as it looked to other people, too, she enjoyed
it.”</p>

<p>“Did you, Diana?” queried Dr. Cheyney mildly,
standing with his hands in his pockets, and a queer
smile on his puckered old face.</p>

<p>“I did,” said Diana, very red.</p>

<p>“Whoopee!” exclaimed the doctor, and went off
into convulsions of laughter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eaton’s wrath passed all bounds. “At your
age,” she said loftily to Diana, “I should have been
ashamed to confess it.”</p>

<p>“I am,” said Diana.</p>

<p>“I’m truly glad of it!” cried Mrs. Eaton.</p>

<p>“Let’s get the stuffing out of it, Jinny,” suggested
the colonel mildly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” said Mrs. Eaton
stiffly. “I should call that an extremely vulgar expression.
I’m very glad that Diana is ashamed, and
I only hope it will never occur again. In my day,
young ladies of social prominence were careful who
they danced with. I’m sure I can’t see any reason
for Diana dancing with Mr. Trench. Any one who
reads that abominable speech of his at Cresset’s can
see, at a glance, that he’s an anarchist.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“Don’t you think that’s going some, Jinny?”
argued the colonel mildly; “you might have said
socialist, and still been rather strong.”</p>

<p>“I never could see any difference,” retorted the
lady firmly, settling herself in the most comfortable
wicker armchair. “An anarchist blows up everything,
and a socialist advises you to blow up everything;
the difference is altogether too fine for me!”</p>

<p>“Just the difference between cause and effect, eh,
madam?” suggested the doctor delightedly, “and all
ending in explosion.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Mrs. Eaton, with an air of finality.
“Diana, why in the world did you dance with him?”</p>

<p>“Because you and Jacob didn’t want me to,”
Diana replied calmly.</p>

<p>Both the old men chuckled, and Mrs. Eaton
reddened with anger. “You are very unnatural,
Diana,” she said severely. “Jacob and I have your
interests at heart. He didn’t consider the man a
proper person for you to be acquainted with!”</p>

<p>Diana opened her lips to reply, but the colonel
forestalled her, anticipating trouble. “He’s been
my guest, Jinny,” he remarked placidly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eaton teased her head. “You’d entertain
Tom, Dick and Harry for charity’s sake, Cousin
David,” she retorted; “the first time I saw him here
he brought six cents in change to your daughter.”</p>

<p>“He’s honest, Mrs. Eaton,” said the doctor,
twinkling; “he’s a Quaker.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about Quakers,” she replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
stiffly, “I never met one!” and her tone signified
that she did not want to.</p>

<p>“Well, they’re not anarchists, Jinny!” observed
the colonel; “perhaps, you’ve heard of William
Penn.”</p>

<p>“I’m not quite a fool, David,” she retorted in
exasperation.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney was enjoying himself; he had taken
the rocker by the steps and was swaying gently, his
broad straw hat on his knee. He took the New York
paper out of his pocket and unfolded it. “Perhaps
you’d like to read a review of the Cresset speech,
madam?” he said amiably; “they’ve got it here,
and they speak of Trench as a young lawyer who
has suddenly roused a State from apathy.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mrs. Eaton, with overwhelming
politeness, “you are too kind. Probably Diana
would like to read it.”</p>

<p>Diana was rosy with anger, and her eyes sparkled.
“Cousin Jinny, I don’t like the man any better than
you do!” she declared, “and I detest and loathe
that Cresset speech; I’ve breakfasted on it, and
dined on it, and supped on it, until—until I hate
the name of it!”</p>

<p>“Diana,” said Dr. Cheyney, “you’ll need those
pink capsules yet!”</p>

<p>“I can’t see what you all admire in that man!”
protested Mrs. Eaton irritably; “he keeps a shop
and he goes to vulgar political meetings; if that isn’t
enough, what is?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“Why, the truth is, Jinny, that he’s a real live
man,” said the colonel, putting on his spectacles to
read the New York version of the Cresset speech.</p>

<p>“I prefer a gentleman,” said Mrs. Eaton crushingly.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney twinkled. “Madam,” he said superbly,
“so do I.”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall, meanwhile, was following the
speech, line by line, with his finger. Half-way down
the column, he lowered the paper. “After all, he
was advocating the Australian ballot,” he remarked
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“He wants to go to the people for the election of
senators,” said Dr. Cheyney; “he doesn’t believe
in our legislatures when the great corporations are
interested. Yes, I suppose he does like the Australian
ballot.”</p>

<p>“I should think he would,” said Mrs. Eaton
promptly; “I’ve always looked upon Australia as
a penal settlement.”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney shook with silent laughter again.
“Madam,” he said, “do you think him a possible
ticket-of-leave man?”</p>

<p>“I am disposed to think anything of a man who
can and does support Garnett Yarnall for governor,”
she replied frigidly.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney’s face sobered suddenly, and Colonel
Royall rustled the paper uneasily. After all, she had
cause; a Yarnall had shot her husband. The two
men felt it less keenly than Diana. She rose suddenly
and offered her elderly relative her arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“Cousin Jinny, let’s go and see my new rose stocks,”
she said mildly; “they’ve been set out in the south
garden.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Eaton rose, propitiated, and accepted Diana’s
arm, the two moving off together in apparent amity.
Dr. Cheyney’s eyes followed them, and then came
back to meet the peculiar sadness of Colonel Royall’s.</p>

<p>“Do you think she’s—she’s like—” The colonel’s
voice trailed; he was looking after Diana.</p>

<p>“No,” said Dr. Cheyney sharply, “no, she’s like
your mother.”</p>

<p>The wistful expression died in the other man’s
eyes, and he forced a smile. “You think so? Perhaps
she does. Mother was a good woman, God bless her
memory,” he added reverently, “but a month ago”—he
leaned forward, and the hands that gripped the
arms of his chair trembled slightly—“a month ago I
caught her looking at me; her eyes are hazel, and”—he
avoided the doctor’s glance, and colored with the
slow painfulness of an old man’s blush—“her eyes
were just like her mother’s.”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney got up abruptly and laid his hand on
his shoulder. “Wake up, David,” he said sharply,
“wake up—you’re dreaming.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t breathed it to any one else, William,”
Colonel Royall said, “not in eighteen years—but
I’ve seen it all the time.”</p>

<p>His old friend eyed him grimly. “And it’s frightened
you?”</p>

<p>The colonel drew a deep breath. “William,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
said, “do you know how a starving man would feel
when he saw his last crust in danger?”</p>

<p>The old doctor paced the broad veranda; beside
it a tree of heaven spread its graceful limbs, every
branch still double tipped with the rosy leaves of its
spring budding. Before him stretched the tender
green of the south lawn, shaded by the grove of horse-chestnuts;
beyond he caught a distant glimpse of the river.</p>

<p>“David,” he said uncompromisingly, “Diana has
a noble heart, but—Jinny Eaton is a fool.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” said the colonel thoughtfully, “but
she’s been a mother to the girl and she loves
her.”</p>

<p>“She wants to marry her to Jacob,” snapped the
doctor.</p>

<p>“I know it,” said the colonel.</p>

<p>“He’s not fit to tie her shoe,” retorted the doctor.
“Jacob’s the slickest critter in the county, but I
haven’t got any more use for him than Caleb Trench
has—if he is your cousin.”</p>

<p>The colonel looked thoughtful. “He’s very clever,
William,” he protested, “and he’s very much in
love.”</p>

<p>“Fiddlesticks!” said the doctor.</p>

<p>Colonel Royall laughed a little in spite of himself.
“You love Diana, too,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“I do,” said William Cheyney, “and I don’t believe
Jacob will make her happy. But, Lord bless me,
David, you and I won’t do the choosing—Miss Di<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
will! In my opinion it won’t be Jacob Eaton, either.”
Then he added briskly: “This young lawyer of ours is
right about Aylett; he’s a machine man and the
machine is rotten. We want Yarnall; I wish you’d
come to think so, too.”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall thought, putting the tips of his
fingers together. “The truth is, the Eatons are too
near to me,” he admitted quietly; “you know Jinny
can’t forget that a Yarnall shot her husband, and I
don’t know that I could ask it of her.”</p>

<p>“Her husband was guilty,” said the doctor flatly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he was,” admitted Colonel Royall,
“though Mrs. Yarnall denied it; the jury justified
Yarnall.”</p>

<p>“I can’t forgive one man for shooting another for
an unworthy woman!” said the doctor fiercely, forgetting
many things.</p>

<p>The slow red crept up to Colonel Royall’s hair. “I
ought to have done it,” he said simply; “but—but
I let him live to marry her.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” said William Cheyney; “solidly right,
too; that’s purgatory enough for most of ’em,” he
added, under his breath, as he took the long turn on
the veranda.</p>

<p>Colonel Royall did not hear him; his head was bare,
and the light breeze stirred his white hair; it had
turned suddenly, twenty years before. “It would
be against all precedent for any of the family to favor
a Yarnall,” he remarked slowly.</p>

<p>“Jacob won’t,” said the doctor shortly, a dry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
smile crinkling the wrinkles around his kindly, shrewd
old eyes.</p>

<p>“Nor would you, in Jacob’s place,” countered the
colonel, tapping the floor with his stick.</p>

<p>A negro appeared promptly at the door.</p>

<p>“Two juleps, Kingdom,” he ordered.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney ceased his promenade and sat down.
“This State’s got to be cleaned up, David,” he said
maliciously; “we’ve got too much machine. I’m
all for Trench.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure I know what ails us,” objected the
colonel humorously; “we’re either bewitched or
hypnotized. In a fortnight we’ve set up Caleb
Trench, and I reckon he’s more talked of than the
volcano in the West Indies.”</p>

<p>“He will be later,” said the doctor; “there’s a
man for you!”</p>

<p>“They say he began by getting hold of the backwoodsmen;
they go down to his shop and discuss
politics once a week; he organized them into a club
and made them take a pledge to vote for Yarnall.”</p>

<p>“All rot,” said William Cheyney fiercely; “do you
think the man’s a damned rogue? He’s talked
straight politics to ’em, and he’s showed up some of
the machine methods. By the way, David, he’s
set his face against Jacob Eaton’s get-rich-quick
games. I don’t believe in ’em myself; when that
young bounder, Macdougall, came at me about them
the other day in the bank, I told him I kept all my
money tied up in a stocking. I reckon he thinks I do,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
twinkled the doctor, “because I’ve nothing in their
bank. David, I hope you’re not favoring Jacob’s
schemes too heavily?”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall looked perplexed. Kingdom-Come
had just brought out a tray with two tinkling glasses
of iced mint julep, and he watched the white-headed
negro set them out deftly on the little portable basket
tea-table of Diana’s.</p>

<p>“How are you feeling, Kingdom?” Dr. Cheyney
asked genially, eying the juleps.</p>

<p>“Right po’ly, Doctah,” Kingdom replied, showing
his ivories, “but I manages ter keep my color.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” said the doctor, startled.</p>

<p>Kingdom-Come beamed. “But I’se got er mis’ry
in my chest, an’ I reckon I’se got vertigo an’ congestion
ob de brain; I hez dese er dizzy turns, suh.”</p>

<p>“Take some castor oil, Kingdom,” said the doctor,
placidly stirring his julep, “and put a mustard plaster
on your stomach.”</p>

<p>“Yass, suh, thank yo’,” said Kingdom, a little
weakly. “I’se done took two doses ob oil this week,
an’ I’se been rubbin’ myse’f wid some ob dis yer
kittycurah.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” said Dr. Cheyney, “take a pint of
whiskey and go to bed.”</p>

<p>“William,” said Colonel Royall, after Kingdom had
gone, “I don’t see why you set your face so flatly
against Jacob Eaton’s investments. Who has talked
this up?”</p>

<p>“Caleb Trench,” said the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“Heavens!” ejaculated Colonel Royall, “is there
no end?”</p>

<p>“To him?” Dr. Cheyney twinkled, “No, sir, not
yet. He’s taken the packing out of Jacob; he says
that more than half these countrymen vote with the
Eaton faction because they’ve put all their money
in the Eaton Investment Company, and I’ll be
hanged, sir, if he doesn’t state it fairly.”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall got up and stood, a towering figure
of a man, his blue eyes kindled. “William,” he said
hoarsely, “that doesn’t sound honorable.”</p>

<p>“David,” retorted the old man uncompromisingly,
“I tell the truth and shame the devil—I’ve got an
eighty-mile circuit in this county, sir, and it’s true!”</p>

<p>“Then, sir,” said Colonel Royall, “this county’s
rotten.”</p>

<p>William Cheyney leaned back in his chair and
smiled quietly. “It’s the same way in the State;
the Eaton Company’s offering bigger interest than
any other company this side of the Mississippi; it
hasn’t cut its rate, even in the panic, and it’s getting
new investors every day—or it did till Caleb Trench
got up at Cresset and cut the thing in two.”</p>

<p>“Caleb Trench?” repeated the colonel slowly.
“William, that young man’s creating a sensation.
I begin to doubt him; does he mean it, or is he bidding
for notoriety?”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney smiled grimly. “David,” he said,
“you ask Judge Hollis; he believes in him and so
do I.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“I don’t know why I shouldn’t believe in Jacob,”
said the colonel stiffly; “he’s my own blood, and we
might as well believe in one young man as another.
What’s the difference between them?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the doctor slowly, “when I go into
a grocery store and see one basket of eggs labelled
‘Box eggs, fresh, thirty-two cents,’ and the other
basket, ‘Hen’s eggs, forty-five cents,’ I’m kind of
naturally suspicious of the box eggs. Not that I
want to bear too hard on Jacob.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MEANWHILE Jacob Eaton rode out with
Diana in the early mornings, before even
Dr. Cheyney had his breakfast. Jacob had
no taste for sunrise or the lark, but if Diana rode in
the first freshness of morning, he rode stubbornly beside
her, more stubbornly than she cared to admit.</p>

<p>After all, Jacob was her third cousin, and the propinquity,
with the close family relations which Mrs.
Eaton jealously maintained, made him seem even
nearer. Without liking him very much, Diana had
tolerated his constant presence for so many years
that it had become a habit. No doubt we could grow
happily accustomed to a hippopotamus as a pet, if
we could keep it long enough in our individual bathtubs.
Usage and propinquity! How many recalcitrants
have been reconciled to an unwelcome fate by
these two potent factors in life!</p>

<p>Diana, riding up the hill through clustered masses
of rhododendrons, was happily indifferent to Jacob at
her bridle rein. Jacob was useful, rather pleasant to
talk to, and paid her the constant homage of undisguised
admiration. After all, it was pleasant to be
with one to whom she meant so much. She could
hold him lightly at arm’s length, for Jacob was too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
wise to hazard all for nothing, yet she was aware that
her lightest wish had its weight. It was only when he
tried to assume the right of an elder brother to meddle
with her affairs, as he had at Kitty Broughton’s ball,
that she resented his interference.</p>

<p>Jacob had, indeed, slipped into her ways with a
tame-cattiness which, no matter how it accorded with
his sleek appearance, was in direct contradiction to
the character behind the mask. Diana, flouting him
in her girlish coquetry, was but sowing the wind; if
she married him later, she would reap the whirlwind,
yet half her relations desired it. Thus wisely does
the outsider plan a life.</p>

<p>Diana stopped abruptly and, bending from the
saddle, gathered a large cluster of pink rhododendrons;
the dew was on them still and it sparkled in
the sunshine.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you let me break it for you?” Jacob
asked mildly; “sometime when you bend that way
from your saddle you’ll lose your balance and—”</p>

<p>“Take a cropper,” said Diana. “I hope I shan’t
break my nose.”</p>

<p>“Or your head, which would mean my heart,” he
retorted.</p>

<p>She laughed; she was very charming when she
laughed and, perhaps, she knew it. Diana was very
human. “Which is harder than my head,” she said;
“in fact, I have heard something of the nether
millstone.”</p>

<p>“You would find it very brittle if you turned the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
cold shoulder,” said Jacob calmly, flicking the young
shrubs with his crop.</p>

<p>“A piece of broken crockery,” mocked Diana; “you
will have it mended when I marry some one
else.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” he retorted, unmoved, “to quote
the romancer: ‘<i>Je vais me fich’ à l’eau.</i>’”</p>

<p>“What?” she questioned, with lifted brows.</p>

<p>“It’s French,” he explained.</p>

<p>“So I supposed,” replied Diana, “but not as I
learned it.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless it is forcible,” said Jacob; “it means,
inelegantly, that I will pitch myself into the river.”</p>

<p>“Inelegant and untruthful then,” said she.</p>

<p>“I got it from a book,” he said, “a recent one, and
famous. I am quoting the modern novelists.”</p>

<p>They had reached the crest of a low ridge, and
through a growth of red cedars could see the flash
and leap of the river. Diana drew rein and turned
her face fully toward her companion.</p>

<p>“Jacob,” she said abruptly, “why did you give all
that money to Juniper?”</p>

<p>Jacob smiled, his eyelids drooping; in the sunshine
his clear smooth skin looked waxy, as though it would
take the impression of a finger and keep it. “There’s
an instance of my heart, Diana,” he said sententiously.</p>

<p>She studied him attentively. “Was it altogether
that?” she demanded, the straight line of her brows
slightly contracted.</p>

<p>“What else?” he asked lightly, leaning forward to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
break off a cedar berry and toss it away again. “Look
here, Di, you’re down on me—what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“I want to understand you,” she replied slowly;
“fifty dollars is too large a sum to give all at once to
a negro; you’ll corrupt a member of the church, a
brand snatched from the burning. Juniper has experienced
religion.”</p>

<p>Jacob laughed. “Been stealing chickens lately, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>“No, it was Lysander,” corrected Diana demurely.</p>

<p>“The shopkeeper lawyer can defend him again,”
said her cousin; “all the fools are not dead yet.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” she agreed, so heartily that he
looked up quickly.</p>

<p>“I really meant to help the old nigger,” he said
frankly; “he’s always begging, and he’s been sick
and out of work. I’m sorry if you think fifty too
much.”</p>

<p>Diana touched her horse lightly, and they moved on.
“Too much at one time,” she said more gently.
“He’ll spend it in an enormous supply of tobacco,
watermelons and whiskey, and probably go to the
workhouse. If he does, you’ll have to bail him out,
Jacob.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there a bare possibility that the watermelons
might kill him?” he suggested meekly.</p>

<p>“A negro?” Diana laughed. “Jacob, why didn’t
you give it to Aunt Charity?”</p>

<p>“She has, at present, purloined the silver teapot,”
said Jacob; “my soul loves justice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>She looked sharply at him, her young face severe.
“I believe you had another motive. Are you sure
that it was for his good, and only for his good?”</p>

<p>“Cross my heart,” said Jacob devoutly. “See here,
Diana, why should I fritter away my substance? Of
what use on earth could that old nigger be to me?”</p>

<p>She looked thoughtful. The horses moved on
evenly abreast. “None that I can see,” she admitted
honestly; “after all, it was good of you; forgive
me.”</p>

<p>“After all, there is some good in me,” he replied,
paraphrasing. “I’m worth noticing, my fair cousin!”</p>

<p>“When you come directly across the horizon!”
laughed Diana.</p>

<p>Below them now was the highroad, and as they
looked along the white bend of its elbow, below the
ash and the young maples, they both saw the tall
straight figure of Caleb Trench. He did not see
them; he passed below them, and turned the shoulder
of the hill. Diana said nothing; her eyes had reluctantly
followed him.</p>

<p>“There goes a fool,” remarked her cousin, “or a
knave.”</p>

<p>“Why is it,” asked Diana, “that a man, failing to
agree with another, calls him names?”</p>

<p>He laughed, his cheek reddening. “Why should I
agree with that shyster?”</p>

<p>“Why should that shyster agree with you?” she
mocked, a light kindling in her clear eyes.</p>

<p>Jacob chuckled unpleasantly. “I hope you’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
never claimed that six cents again,” he commented;
“he’s got your receipt, you know.”</p>

<p>It was her turn to redden. “You are jealous of his
growing reputation,” she flung at him.</p>

<p>He shrugged a shoulder. “Of that beautiful speech
at Cresset’s, in which he painted me as the devil and
all his works?”</p>

<p>“I admired the Cresset speech!” she exclaimed, a
sentiment which would have amazed Mrs. Eaton.</p>

<p>Jacob laughed. “So do I,” he said, “it was first-class
campaign matter, but—well, Di, personal abuse
is a little vulgar, isn’t it, just now?”</p>

<p>“Not if you deserved it,” she said defiantly.</p>

<p>“I’d take any amount if you’d promise not to
dance with him again.”</p>

<p>“I’m the best judge of my partners,” said Diana,
with indignant dignity; “if any one speaks it should
be my father.”</p>

<p>“Aptly said,” he admitted suavely, “and the colonel
is one in a thousand, but you wind him around your
little finger.”</p>

<p>“You do not know Colonel Royall,” said Colonel
Royall’s daughter, with just pride.</p>

<p>Jacob lifted his hat. “<i>Vive le Roi!</i>” he said.</p>

<p>She gave him an indignant glance. “You are a
mocker.”</p>

<p>“On my soul, no!”</p>

<p>“Jacob,” said Diana, “your soul, like the rich
man’s, may scarcely pass through the eye of a
needle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“My dear cousin, my soul has been passing through
it under your rebukes. What shall I do to please
you?”</p>

<p>Diana rode on, her chin up. The path was narrow,
and Jacob, falling behind, had only the privilege of
admiring the long slim lines of her athletic young
back, and the way she sat her horse. Beyond the
cedars the path forked on the road, and he came up
again.</p>

<p>“I am chastened,” he said; “shall I be forgiven?”</p>

<p>She laughed softly, then her mood changed.
“Jacob,” she said, quite seriously, “you are sure
that you’ll renominate Governor Aylett?”</p>

<p>“My dear Di, I am sure of nothing in this world but
death,” he retorted dryly, “but I’ll be—”</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Jacob,” she cautioned, her eyes
twinkling.</p>

<p>“I won’t have Yarnall!” he finished lamely.</p>

<p>She nodded. “I understand, but what is this about
the backwoodsmen being organized?”</p>

<p>“Your friend, the shyster,” he mocked, “he has
that line of politics; he speaks well on top of a barrel.
I suppose he can empty one, too.”</p>

<p>“Not as easily as you could, Jacob,” she retorted
ruthlessly.</p>

<p>He raised his eyebrows. “I’ve been in love with
you these many years, and thus do you trample on
my feelings!”</p>

<p>“I wish you had feelings,” said Diana calmly;
“you have mechanism.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“Upon my word!” he cried; “this is the last
straw.”</p>

<p>“You should be a successful politician,” she continued;
“you are a successful business man. Success
is your Moloch; beware, Jacob!”</p>

<p>“I am willing to sit at the feet of the prophetess,”
he protested. “I’ve served seven years, I—”</p>

<p>“Jacob,” said Diana, “don’t be silly. There’s
Kingdom-Come at the gate; they are waiting to turn
the omelet. Come!” and she galloped down to the
high gateway, the rhododendrons clustering at her
saddle-bow and the sunshine in her face.</p>

<p>Kingdom-Come grinned. “Fo’ de Lawd, Miss Di,
I reckon yo’ clean forgot dat folks eats in de mawnin’.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next morning Judge Hollis walked into
Caleb Trench’s little back room.</p>

<p>In the broad daylight the judge was a
stately figure, tall, stout, white-haired, with a high
Roman nose and a mouth and chin like a Spartan’s.
He always wore an old-fashioned, long frock coat, a
high pointed collar and stiff black tie; in summer his
waistcoat was white marseilles, with large buttons and
a heavy watch-chain; he carried a gold-headed cane
and he took snuff.</p>

<p>He found Trench in his shirt sleeves, plodding over
some papers, his face flushed and his jaw set, a trick
he had in perplexity. The judge eyed him grimly.
“Well,” he said, “what’s the price of cockerels
to-day?”</p>

<p>Trench, who had not noticed his entrance, rose and
gave the old man a chair. “To-day I’m figuring out
the price of men,” he replied; “every single investor
in the Eaton Land Company has been notified—in
one way or another—that only Aylett men are to
go to the Democratic Convention.”</p>

<p>The judge whistled softly.</p>

<p>“It’s true,” said Trench, throwing back his head
with a peculiar gesture of the right hand that was at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
once characteristic and striking. “I’m ashamed for
you Democrats,” he added.</p>

<p>The judge squared his massive shoulders and
gripped his gold-headed cane. “You young black
Republican agitator,” he retorted bitterly, “produce
your evidence.”</p>

<p>Trench brought his palm down sharply on his desk.
“It’s here,” he said; “Aaron Todd has been threatened,
but he did not put in his last savings and is
standing firm; the rest are like frightened sheep.
Because I pointed out this lever in my Cresset speech
they seem to think it’s a fulfillment, and they’ve
poured in on me to-day to beg me to get their investments
out for them! Meanwhile the company has
declared that no dividends will be paid until after
election, neither will they refund. If I carry the cases
into court against Eaton, he’ll take advantage of the
bankruptcy law. The investors in the country are
frightened to death, and they’d vote for Satan for
governor if they thought it would insure their money.
Yarnall’s an honest man, but there are fifty hand-bills
in circulation accusing him of everything
short of arson and murder. That’s your Democratic
campaign.”</p>

<p>“And your Republican one is to stir up the niggers,”
thundered the judge. “Peter Mahan’s been out in the
Bottoms speaking to ten thousand blacks! By the
Lord Harry, sir, I wish they were all stuffed down his
throat!”</p>

<p>Whereat Caleb Trench laughed suddenly. “Judge,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
he said, “if Peter Mahan could be elected, you’d have
a clean straight administration.”</p>

<p>“He can’t be, sir,” snapped the judge, “and I’m
glad of it!”</p>

<p>“You’ll be sorry,” Trench remarked calmly, “unless
you nominate Yarnall.”</p>

<p>“I’m for Aylett,” the judge said soberly. “I shall
vote for Aylett in the convention; Yarnall will split
the party. That’s what you want, you young cub!”</p>

<p>Caleb smiled. “I’m interested to know how much
money it will take to nominate Aylett,” he said;
“you’re for Aylett, judge, but you’re not strong
enough to defeat Yarnall.”</p>

<p>“Neither are you strong enough to nominate him,”
said the judge sharply. “You look out for the blood
feud, Caleb; these fellows behind Jacob Eaton
haven’t forgotten that the Yarnalls drew the last
blood. They’re mighty like North American Indians,
and your Cresset speech stirred up a hornet’s nest.
I’m for Aylett and peace.”</p>

<p>Trench folded the papers on his desk reflectively.
“I can’t make out Jacob Eaton,” he said.</p>

<p>The judge chuckled. “He’s a mighty queer package,”
he said grimly, “a cross between a mollycoddle
and a bully. Jinny Eaton raised him in jeweler’s
cotton for fear he’d catch the measles, and he went
to college with a silver christening mug and a silk
quilt. When he got there he drank whiskey and
played the races, and some poor devil, who was
working his way through college, coached him for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
his exams. He got out with a diploma but no honors,
and enough bad habits to sink a ship. Then Jinny
introduced him to society as the Model Young Man.
He’s been speculating ever since, and he’s got the
shrewd business sense that old man Eaton had. He
doesn’t care two cents for Aylett, but he’s going to
fight Yarnall to the knife. He— What the devil’s
the matter with Zeb Bartlett?” the judge suddenly
added, stooping to look out of the window. “He’s
been walking past the front door, back and forth,
four or five times since I’ve been sitting here, and
he’s making faces until he looks like a sculpin.”</p>

<p>Trench laughed grimly. “He does that at intervals,”
he replied, “because I won’t lend him a dollar
to get tipsy on.”</p>

<p>The judge grunted, his head still lowered to command
a view of the shambling figure of the idiot.
Then he rose suddenly and went to the window,
thrusting his hand into his pocket. “Here, Zeb!”
he shouted, in his stentorian tones, “take that and
get drunk, and I’ll have you arrested,” and he flung
out fifty cents.</p>

<p>Bartlett groveled for it in the dust, found it and
grinned idiotically. Then, retreating a few steps, he
looked back and kissed his hand, still gurgling. The
judge watched him out of sight, then he sat down and
took snuff. “Don’t let that fool hang around here,”
he said sharply; “it will get a crank into his head and
the Lord knows how it’s going to come out. Give him
a quarter and let him go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“I won’t,” said Caleb dryly. “I’d rather give it to
his grandmother; she’ll need it.”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said the judge ironically, “and
she’d give it to him with a dime on top of it;
that’s a woman down to the ground. If there’s
anything worthless within a hundred miles, they’ll
adore it!”</p>

<p>As he spoke, there was a rustle in the outer shop and
Miss Sarah suddenly thrust her head in the door. She
always wore the most extraordinary bonnets, and the
one to-day had a long green plume that trembled and
swayed behind her head like the pendulum of an
eight-day clock.</p>

<p>“Judge,” she said, “I wish you’d get up and go
home. It sounds rude, Caleb, but he’s always insisting
on dinner at one o’clock sharp, because his
grandmother had it, and he’s never there until the
roast is overdone or the gravy is spoiled! Besides,
I’m alarmed; I’ve discovered something about Juniper.”
Miss Sarah came in and shut the door and put
her back against it, her air conveying some deep and
awful mystery. “He’s got fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>The judge brought down his heavy brows over his
high nose in a judicial frown, but his eyes snapped.
“What’s the nigger been up to?” he asked calmly;
“been negotiating law business for him, Trench?”</p>

<p>Caleb shook his head, smiling.</p>

<p>“He’s been stealing,” said Miss Sarah with conviction.</p>

<p>“Think likely,” said the judge, “but from whom?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Not me, Sarah; if it had been from me it would have
been fifty cents.”</p>

<p>“I never thought it was from you,” she retorted
scornfully, “but I’ve hunted the house over to see
if he could have pawned anything and—”</p>

<p>The judge brought his hand down on his knee.
“The silver teapot, Sarah!”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “Aunt Charity’s got it; she
gave a supper last night and they had their usual
fight and she locked him out. He sat on the step all
night and came to our house for something to eat;
then he showed the fifty-dollar bill. Of course he
stole it.”</p>

<p>The judge meditated, looking grim.</p>

<p>It was Trench who made the suggestion. “Isn’t
that rather large for campaign money?” he asked
mildly.</p>

<p>The judge swore, then he got up and reached for
his hat. “I’ll make him take it back,” he said
viciously.</p>

<p>“Take it where?” demanded Miss Sarah vaguely.</p>

<p>“To Ballyshank!” retorted the judge, jamming
his hat down on his head.</p>

<p>They all emerged into the outer room just as Miss
Royall appeared in the shop-door. She was dressed
in a pink muslin with a wide straw hat trimmed with
pink roses, and looked like a woodland nymph. The
judge swung off his hat.</p>

<p>“We’ve been having a political tournament,” he
said, “and now comes the Queen of Love and Beauty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>Diana liked the old man and smiled her most charming
smile. Miss Sarah went up and pecked her cheek,
a rite that elderly ladies still like to perform in public.
Trench, longing to play the host but too proud to
risk a rebuke, bowed silently. Something in Diana’s
eye warned him that she was minded to make him
repent the dance she had given him; the scoldings
she had received were rankling in her mind. Unhappily,
too, something in the judge’s manner said,
“So ho! is this a flirtation?” Her cheeks burned.</p>

<p>The judge blundered. “Let me offer a chair,”
he said, with old-fashioned courtesy, “then we will
ask you to help us solve a riddle of Sarah’s. She has
found that Juniper is unusually rich, a kind of ebony
John Jacob Astor, the proud possessor of fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>Diana declined the chair. “Juniper?” she repeated.
“Oh, yes, I know all about it!”</p>

<p>“Did he steal it from you, dear?” Miss Sarah
asked excitedly.</p>

<p>“Jacob Eaton gave it to him,” Diana replied
simply, “he thought he needed it; he’s been out of
work, and you know what a nuisance Lysander is.”</p>

<p>“But fifty dollars, my dear!” protested Miss
Hollis faintly.</p>

<p>Diana caught the glances between the judge and
Trench and stiffened. “My cousin is generous,” she
said.</p>

<p>The judge took snuff.</p>

<p>Poor Caleb fell into the snare. “Miss Royall, do
sit down,” he urged, pushing forward the chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>Diana’s chin went up; her eyes sparkled. “Thank
you, I only came for that bolt of pink ribbon,” she
said grandly, indicating it with her parasol, and then,
opening her purse, “How much is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s sold,” said Trench, and shut his lips like a
steel trap.</p>

<p>Diana turned crimson. “Oh,” she said, then she
swung around and drew her arm through Miss Sarah’s
thin black silk-clad elbow, that was like the hook of
a grappling iron. “I think you were going?” she
cooed.</p>

<p>The old lady hesitated, confused. “I—I—”
she began.</p>

<p>“Here’s the carriage,” said Diana sweetly, and
drew her out of the door; “there’s room for you,
judge,” she called back, not even glancing at Trench.</p>

<p>“I’ll walk,” said the judge, “I’m a young man
yet; don’t you forget it, my girl!”</p>

<p>Diana laughed. “The youngest I know, in heart,”
she said, and waved her hand as they drove off.</p>

<p>The judge looked at Caleb soberly. “You’ve done
it, young man,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>A slow painful blush went up to Caleb’s hair.
“So be it,” he said bitterly. “I’m human and I’ve
borne all I can,” and he turned away. “My God!”
he added, with a violence so unusual and so heartfelt
that it startled the judge, “does that girl think
me the dirt under her feet because I’ve sold ribbon?
I’m a gentleman; I’m as well-born and as well-bred
as she is, but she won’t recognize it—more than half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
an hour. One day she’s—she’s an angel of courtesy
and kindness, the next she insults me. She and
Eaton have made my life here a hell!” He clenched
his hands until the nails bit into the flesh.</p>

<p>“She’s young,” said Judge Hollis slowly, “and
ill advised.”</p>

<p>Trench struggled to be calm; his face paled again,
the light died out of his eyes. “Let her leave me in
peace!” he cried at last.</p>

<p>The judge drew a pattern on the floor with his
stick. “She admires you immensely,” he said deliberately,
“and she respects you.”</p>

<p>Trench laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>The judge put on his hat again and held out his
hand. “I’ll give you the odds on the money, Caleb,”
he said, “but I’d like to know—by the Lord Harry,
I’d like to know—what Eaton’s buying niggers for
at this late date?”</p>

<p>He got no answer. Caleb’s face was as set as
flint.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SOMETIMES early in the morning, and often
at evening, Caleb Trench took long walks alone
with his dog. It was after sunset, in the sweet
long twilight of July, that he came up through the
woods behind Colonel Royall’s place, and approached
the long elbow of the road, shadowed by the tall
walnuts and hickories, and clothed here and there
with the black-jack oak. Before him lay the beautiful
valley. He could see the curl of the mist below
Paradise Ridge, and beyond, the long gray folds of
the distant mountains. He looked up toward the
beaten trail that led to Angel Pass, and he could
perceive the fragrance of wild magnolias.</p>

<p>Shot, who was running ahead, stopped suddenly
and stood at attention, one shaggy ear erect. Then
Caleb saw the gleam of a white dress, and Miss Diana
Royall appeared, walking toward them. Over her
head the green boughs locked, and in the soft light
she had a beauty that seemed to Trench more than
the right of a girl so apparently heartless. He would
have passed by the other road, merely raising his
hat, but she called to him.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mr. Trench,” she said, with that
bewitching little drawl of hers, which made her voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
almost caressing and deceived the unwary. “Your
dog remembers me more often than you do.”</p>

<p>Caleb’s face stiffened. Oh, the mockery of women!
“I remember you more often than you remember
me,” he replied courteously.</p>

<p>Diana bit her lip. She had not expected this, and
she hated him for it; yet he had never looked so strong
and fine as he did to-night. In the soft light the
harsh lines were softened, the power remained, and
something of sweetness in the eyes. “Oh,” she said,
“have I ever failed to remember you?”</p>

<p>Trench made no direct reply, but smiled. Something
in her way, at the moment, was very girlish,
the whim of a spoiled child. She had been gathering
some ferns, and she arranged them elaborately,
standing in the path. His attitude vexed her, his
manner was so detached; she was accustomed to
adulation. She swept him a look from under her
thick dark lashes. “I remember dancing with you
at Kitty Broughton’s ball,” she observed.</p>

<p>“You were very kind,” he replied at once, “I remember
it, too; you danced with me twice.”</p>

<p>“Because I promised to dance if you asked me; I
promised Judge Hollis,” she said demurely.</p>

<p>“But the second?” Caleb was human, and his
heart quickened under the spell of her beauty. “I
hope that was on my own account.”</p>

<p>“The second?” Diana rearranged the ferns. “I
danced then because my cousin did not wish me to,”
she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>Trench reddened. “I am sorry that you felt compelled
to do it—twice,” he said involuntarily, for he
was angry.</p>

<p>“You are very rude,” replied Diana, unmoved.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said stiffly, aware that he
had been foolish and lost his temper; “pray forgive
me.”</p>

<p>“It’s a matter of no consequence,” she said sweetly.</p>

<p>His heart was filled with sudden wrath. Why need
the girl be so brutal? He did not know that Diana
had been goaded by Mrs. Eaton and Jacob until she
was beyond reason; besides, his manner, which defied
her, was like tossing the glove at her feet. He
had no appreciation of her condescension, and he
did not bear her flouting with meekness. Yet, all
the while, his strength and his repose made him
immeasurably more interesting than the young men
of her acquaintance, which, of course, was another
reason to be unreasonable.</p>

<p>“I did not see you at the Wilton-Cheyneys,”
she said agreeably, pressing the ferns against her
cheek.</p>

<p>“Quite naturally,” he replied coolly; “I was not
asked.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>There was a silence. The sweet soft twilight
seemed to enfold them with a touch like velvet; a
Bob White whistled once in the stillness.</p>

<p>“Miss Royall.”</p>

<p>She looked up with her soft little smile, but his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
face froze it on her lips. He looked stern and cold.
“Yes?” she said, faintly startled.</p>

<p>“Why do you say such things to me? You know
that I’m not asked, that I’m an outsider. A poor
Yankee shopkeeper, I believe your set calls me; I
do not know. Certainly I do not care; a man must
live, you know, even out of your class. I have a
right to live. I also have a right to my own pride.
I am a gentleman.”</p>

<p>They stood looking at each other, the width of
the woodland path between them, and that indefinable,
impalpable thing which is neither sympathy
nor antagonism but which, existing once between
two souls, can, never be forgotten,—a white flame
that burns at once through all barriers of misunderstanding,
the divine spark of a love that is as far
beyond commonplace passion as the soul is above
the body that it must leave forever. The man felt
it and bowed reluctantly before it; the girl struggled
and resisted.</p>

<p>“If I did not know that you were,” she said, as
quietly as she could, “I would not be here talking
to you now. I’m afraid you think me very ill mannered.
The last was really thoughtlessness.”</p>

<p>He looked at her relentlessly. “But the first?”</p>

<p>She blushed scarlet. “I—I did not mean it.”</p>

<p>His eyes still searched her, but there was no tenderness
in them; they were cold and gray. “That
is not quite true, Miss Royall.”</p>

<p>Diana winced; she felt ten years old and knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
it was her own fault. “I think it is you who are rude
now,” she said, rallying, “but”—it choked her,
she held out her hand—“let us be friends.”</p>

<p>He shook his head slowly. “No,” he said, “that
can’t be until you are sure I am your equal. I’ve
picked up crumbs long enough, Miss Royall,—forgive
me.”</p>

<p>She experienced a curious feeling of defeat, as her
hand dropped at her side. She was angry, yet she
admired him for it. She remembered that night
when he brought the hateful six pennies and she had
behaved disgracefully. Would he always put her in
the wrong? “I am sorry,” she said haughtily; “I
was offering you my friendship.”</p>

<p>He smiled bitterly. “Were you, or mocking me
with it?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Trench!”</p>

<p>“Forgive me,” he said, in a low voice, but with
less self-control, “I came here a poor man; it was
necessary to make my bread, and I would have swept
offices to do it. I asked nothing and I received”—he
smiled with exceeding bitterness—“nothing.
Then, unhappily, Judge Hollis found out that I was
well-born; he told a few people that I was a gentleman.
It was a serious mistake; I have been treated
like a dog ever since.” He was thrashing the wayside
brush with his stick, and unconsciously beheaded
a dozen flowers; they fell at Diana’s feet,
but neither of them looked down. “I do not wish
to force myself upon your acquaintance, Miss Royall,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
he went on, the torrent of pent-up passion unspent.
“I understand the reason of your condescension at
the ball, but couldn’t you have found a more agreeable
way to chastise your cousin? I must have been
insufferable?”</p>

<p>The intensity of the man’s wounded pride had
forced itself upon Diana; she was crimson with
mortification, yet she understood him—understood
him with a temperamental sympathy that sent a
thrill of alarm through her consciousness. “I never
knew before how very bad my manners were,” she
said simply.</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her. All that was womanly
and beautiful in her face was crystallized in the colorless
atmosphere; her eyes dwelt upon him with a
kindness that was at once new and wholly unbearable.
“I’m a cub!” he retorted harshly; “how you
must hate me!”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” she said very sweetly, “I like
you.”</p>

<p>Their eyes met with a challenge of angry pride,
then a whimsical smile quivered at the corners of her
mouth, and she clasped her hands innocently over
her ferns. “When you begin to like me we shall be
friends,” she said.</p>

<p>There was an instant of awkward silence, and then
they both laughed, not happily, but with a nervous
quiver that suggested hysterical emotion.</p>

<p>“I do not know when I began—to dislike you,”
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“I deserved it from the first, I fancy,” she retorted,
hurrying on with her determination to show
her repentance; “I have behaved like a snob.”</p>

<p>He did not reply; he stooped, instead, to pick up
the flowers that he had broken. “My mother would
never step on a flower or leave it to die in the road,”
he explained simply; “whenever I remember it I
pick them up. As a boy I recollect thinking that
there was some significance in it, that I must not
leave them to die.”</p>

<p>Diana looked at him curiously, from under her
lashes. What manner of man was he? “It is a
sweet thought,” she said, “in a woman—a tenderness
of heart.”</p>

<p>“Her heart was as tender as her soul was beautiful,”
said Caleb Trench; “she died when I was
twenty years old.”</p>

<p>Diana held out her hand. “Will you give me the
flowers?” she asked simply.</p>

<p>He gave them with a slight flush of surprise. “They
are poor and broken,” he apologized lamely.</p>

<p>“I see that you think I have neither a heart nor a
soul,” she replied.</p>

<p>He smiled. “I do not let myself think of either,
Miss Royall,” he said; “I fancy that a wise man will
always avoid the dizzy heights, and even a foolish
one will see a precipice.”</p>

<p>Diana was silent; that she understood him would
have been apparent to the initiated, for her little ears
were red, but the proud curve of her lips remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
firm and the steady glance of her eyes rested on the
darkening valley. The hills had purpled to gray,
the sky was whitening, and in the west the evening
star shone like a point of flame.</p>

<p>Out of the stillness her voice sounded unusually
soft and sweet. “I’m going to have some friends to
tea to-morrow afternoon, Mr. Trench,” she said;
“will you come?”</p>

<p>“No,” he replied, and then added: “Pardon me,
that seems discourteous, but I am not going out again
here, Miss Royall.”</p>

<p>Almost involuntarily she smiled. “We are playing
the game of tit-for-tat, Mr. Trench, and you’ve won.”</p>

<p>“I have been a bear,” he replied, “but—Miss
Royall, it’s growing dark; let me take you home.”</p>

<p>“I am waiting for my cousin,” she replied, and
then blushed hotly. “I promised to wait five minutes,”
she explained hastily, “while he talked to Mr.
Saxton at the farm. I suppose it’s politics; we’ve
been here long enough to quarrel three times.”</p>

<p>Trench assumed her engagement to Jacob Eaton
and would not offer his escort a second time. “I am
taking the dog through the woods,” he said; “shall
we walk as far as the farm gate?”</p>

<p>Diana laughed merrily. “I never went in search of
a lost knight in my life,” she said. “I’m going on;
it’s quite light and beautiful yet—good evening.”</p>

<p>Trench swung around. “I will go with you,” he
said at once, “if you will permit me.”</p>

<p>But at that moment Jacob Eaton came up. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
he recognized Trench, he stopped short and stared.
Then he joined Diana without acknowledging her
companion. “Sorry to keep you waiting,” he said,
“but the old fool was deaf. We may as well go on,
Diana.”</p>

<p>But Diana stood still. “This is Mr. Trench,” she
said.</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other. Eaton had
just heard more of what Caleb Trench thought of
the Land Company, but he knew Diana.</p>

<p>“How d’ye do,” he said curtly.</p>

<p>Trench made no reply. Diana gathered up the
soft white folds of her skirt and took two steps away.
“Good-night, Jacob,” she said sweetly, “Mr. Trench
will see me home. Tell Cousin Jinny I’ll bring over
the terrapin recipe in the morning.”</p>

<p>Jacob said nothing, and Trench whistled to Shot.
The dog came bounding and followed his master and
Miss Royall down the path.</p>

<p>Jacob stood stock-still and regarded what seemed
to him the beginning of miracles. Was it possible
that Diana was in open rebellion against society?
That Diana should be in open rebellion against him
was not amazing. She was wont to let him know
that he was a mere speck on the horizon, but that he
regarded as pretty coquetry, and of no consequence,
because he intended to marry Diana. But that
Diana should, a second time, prefer Caleb Trench to
him was beyond belief, and that she should do it
after certain revelations that he had just heard, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
adding insult to injury, for Jacob had suddenly found
that the poor Yankee shopkeeper lawyer was a foe
worthy of his steel. He remained a long time motionless,
his heavy lids drooping over his eyes and his
brows meditative. He was, after all, a gentleman of
resources, and it was merely a question of how to
use them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was midnight and storming hard when Dr.
Cheyney stopped at Caleb’s door. Trench
heard the wheels and opened it as the old man
climbed down from his high buggy.</p>

<p>“Caleb, I’ve come for brandy; got any?” the
doctor said briefly, coming in with his head bent in
the rain; his rubber coat was drawn up to his ears,
and the tails of it flapped against his thin legs.</p>

<p>Trench had been reading late, and there was a fire
in the stove in the kitchen. “Go in and get dry a
moment, Doctor,” he said, “while I get brandy. It’s
no night for you, and at this hour too; your friends
must remonstrate.”</p>

<p>“Damn it, sir, am I not the doctor?” said the old
man, lowering.</p>

<p>“You’re that and something more, I take it,”
Caleb replied, smiling.</p>

<p>“More?” Dr. Cheyney was out of temper. “Nay,
nay, I’m just a plain doctor, and I can take care of
both your big toes. These new-fangled ones can’t,
sir, that’s all! It’s the fashion now to have a doctor
for your nose and another for your toes and a
third for your stomach. Very good, let ’em! I do it
all and don’t get paid for it; that’s the difference.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“They do,” said Caleb, producing a flask of brandy.</p>

<p>The doctor took it and thrust it deep into his big
outside pocket. “I’ll pay you when I get ready,” he
said dryly.</p>

<p>Trench laughed. He heard the swirl of the rain
against the window-panes; it was nearly as bad as
the day he had sheltered Diana. He looked keenly
at the worn little old man and saw the streams of
water that had streaked his coat. “I have a great
mind to shut you up and keep you all night,” he
remarked.</p>

<p>“For a ransom?” said the doctor grimly; “you
wouldn’t get it. Caleb, that poor girl, Jean Bartlett,
is dying.”</p>

<p>Trench was startled. “I didn’t know she was ill,”
he replied; “Zeb came here and whined for money
when the grandmother died so suddenly, but he said
nothing of Jean.”</p>

<p>“He never does,” said Dr. Cheyney, “the young
brute!”</p>

<p>“Are you going there now?” Caleb asked.</p>

<p>“Yep,” replied the doctor briefly; “I wanted more
brandy, for I’m like to catch my death, but I must
be about,—she’s dying. She may pull through
until morning. Pneumonia—a cold that last bad
storm. She lay out in the field half the night. She’s
done it a hundred times when they harried her; this
time it’s killed her. She’s not twenty.”</p>

<p>Caleb reached for his hat. “I’m going with you,”
he said simply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>Dr. Cheyney threw him one of his shrewd looks.
“Afraid to trust me alone in the wet?” he asked
dryly.</p>

<p>Caleb smiled. “To tell you the truth I was thinking
of Sammy. The poor little dirty beggar appeals
to me, he’s thoroughly boy, in spite of his curious
clothes, and Zeb is a drunken brute.”</p>

<p>The doctor grunted and went out, making room
for Caleb at his side in the buggy. “I’m going to
send Sammy to St. Vincent’s,” he said.</p>

<p>“Poor Sammy!” said Caleb.</p>

<p>The doctor clucked, and old Henk moved off,
splashing through muddy water up to his fetlocks.
The road was dark, and the doctor had swung a lantern
between the back-wheels, a custom dear to rural
communities; it swung there, casting a dismal flare
under the buggy, which looked like a huge lightning-bug,
with fire at its tail.</p>

<p>“Good enough for him!” continued the doctor
bluntly, referring to Sammy and the foundling
asylum.</p>

<p>“Plenty,” assented Caleb, unmoved.</p>

<p>This angered the doctor, as Caleb knew it would.</p>

<p>“Little brat!” growled William Cheyney fiercely,
“what was he born for? Foundling asylum, of
course!”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Caleb, and smiled in the
darkness.</p>

<p>“Damn!” said the doctor.</p>

<p>They traveled on through the night; the wind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
swept the boughs down, and the rain drove in their
faces even under the hood.</p>

<p>“I can’t take him, drat it!” the old man broke
out again fiercely. “I’ve boarded for sixty years;
women are varmints, good women, I mean, and the
Colfaxes wouldn’t take Sammy for a day to save his
soul; he’s a child of shame.”</p>

<p>Caleb laughed silently; he felt the doctor’s towering
wrath. “After all, wouldn’t it be a purgatory
for a small boy to live with the Colfaxes?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yep,” said the doctor, “it would. Miss Maria
pins papers over the cracks in the parlor blinds to
keep the carpet from fading, and Miss Lucinda dusts
my office twice a day, for which she ought to be hung!
I reckon they’d make divided skirts for Sammy and
a frilled nightgown.”</p>

<p>“There are the Children’s Guardians in the city,”
suggested Caleb thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“There’s the Reform School,” retorted the doctor
bitingly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile old Henk traveled on, gaining in speed,
for part of the road was on his way home and he
coveted the flesh-pots of Egypt. The splashing of
his feet in the mire kept time with the sob of the gale.
Nearer and nearer drew the light in Jean Bartlett’s
window.</p>

<p>“I told the Royalls she was dying,” Dr. Cheyney
said, “and to-day Diana was there. She sat with her
an hour and tried to quiet her. Jean was raving and,
at last, I ordered the girl away; she’d no business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
worrying in such a scene as that; then she told me
she would take Sammy! She—Diana!” the old
man flung out his free hand and beat the air, “that
girl! I wanted to shake her. Yet, it’s like her;
she’s got heart.”</p>

<p>Caleb Trench, sitting back in his corner, summoned
up a picture of the old man and Diana, and could not
quite reconcile it with the Diana he knew. “You did
not shake her,” he said; “what did you do?”</p>

<p>“Sent her home,” said the doctor bluntly, “drat
it! Do you think a girl of her age ought to start a
foundling asylum for charity’s sake? I told her her
father would have her ears boxed, and she laughed in
my face. David Royall worships her, but, Lordy, not
even David would tolerate that!”</p>

<p>A low bough scraped the top of the carriage and
they jogged on. Presently, old Henk stopped unwillingly
and they got down, a little wet and stiff,
and went silently into the house. It was stricken
silent, too, except for the ticking of a clock in the
kitchen, and that sounded to Caleb like a minute
gun; it seemed to tick all through the house,—the
three small rooms below, the rickety stairs and the
attic above. There was a light in the kitchen, and
there, on top of some old quilts in a packing box,
lay Sammy asleep.</p>

<p>In the room beyond the kitchen, in the middle of
the great, old-fashioned four-poster, that was worn
and scratched and without a valance, lay Jean Bartlett.
Her fair hair streamed across the pillow, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
thin arms lay extended on either side, her chin was
up, she lay as if on a cross, and she was dead.</p>

<p>From the far corner rose the woman whom the
doctor had left to watch her. “She’s just gone,
doctor,” she said laconically, without emotion.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney shot a look at her from under his
eyebrows, and went over to look at Jean. The light
from the poor little lamp fell full on her thin small-featured
face and showed it calm; she was as pretty as
a child and quite happy looking.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” said the doctor, “that’s over.
Where’s Zeb?”</p>

<p>“Up-stairs, drunk,” said the woman; “if it warn’t
raining so hard I’d go.”</p>

<p>The doctor looked over his spectacles. “Then
you’ll take the child along,” he said gravely.</p>

<p>“That I won’t!” said she, “I’ve children of my
own. I won’t have none such as him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you won’t?” exclaimed the old man.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d take him,” said she, reddening.</p>

<p>“There are two women folks up at the house,” said
the doctor dryly; “being a nameless child—out he
goes!”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care,” said the nurse fiercely, “I
feel so myself; there’s the foundling asylum.”</p>

<p>“He’ll fall on the stove here in the morning,” remarked
the doctor.</p>

<p>The woman shut her mouth.</p>

<p>“Zeb’s drunk,” the old man added.</p>

<p>“I won’t take him,” she said flatly; “if I do, nobody’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
take him away. It’s the same with a baby
as it is with a stray kitten, once you take it you keep
it. I ain’t goin’ to take Jean Bartlett’s brat.”</p>

<p>“Don’t!” snapped the doctor, “for of such is the
kingdom of heaven!”</p>

<p>Then he went out, turning his collar up again to
his ears. “I’m going for the undertaker, Caleb.”</p>

<p>They stopped as he spoke and looked down at
Jean’s boy. He lay with his arm across his face; he
had not been undressed and one foot hung pendent
in a forlorn and heelless shoe.</p>

<p>“The end of the drama,” commented the doctor
dryly, “the sufferer.”</p>

<p>Caleb stooped down and gently lifted the sleeping
child; he wrapped the old quilt about him, and bore
him to the door. The doctor followed, then he
reached over and put his hand on the latch.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>“I’ve taken him,” said Trench calmly; “open the
door.”</p>

<p>“You’ve no one to care for him.” Dr. Cheyney
eyed him keenly.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied; “so much the better, the place
is lonely.”</p>

<p>“You know what they’ll say?”</p>

<p>The young man’s face stiffened. “What?”</p>

<p>“That he’s your child,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“Open the door,” said Caleb Trench.</p>

<p>The doctor opened it, then Trench stood straight,
Sammy’s tousled head on his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“Dr. Cheyney,” he said sternly, “if every stone in
Paradise Ridge rose up to accuse me, I’d still do as
I pleased.”</p>

<p>William Cheyney smiled grimly. “I believe you
would,” he said, “but let me tell you, Caleb, you’ve
got your fate by the forelock now!”</p>

<p>Yet he helped Trench put the sleeping child into
the carriage, and as they did it a new sound gurgled
into the night, the voice of the tippler in the attic,
who had been shut up there alone and frightened,
but was sipping and sipping to keep up his spirits.
Now he sang, one kind of spirits rising as the other
kind went down. And the song that followed them
through the night, as they drove away from the house
of death, with the nameless child between them, was
“After the Ball.”</p>

<p>“The Lord forgive us!” said the doctor musingly;
“it’s ‘after the ball’ with most of us, and then the
straight house! G’long with you, Henk!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JUNIPER’S spouse, Aunt Charity, was in the
habit of sweeping out Caleb’s office and washing
his windows, and the morning after Jean Bartlett’s
death was her morning for scouring the premises.
She was a stout old woman, nearly black, with
a high pompadour, the arms and shoulders of a stonemason,
and “a mighty misery” in her side. She
stopped five times in the course of sweeping the inner
office and stood, leaning on her broom, to survey
the bundle of indiscriminate clothes on the floor,
which was Sammy.</p>

<p>The transfer had disturbed him so little that, after
his first screams of surprise, he had renewed his insatiable
demands for pennies, and having one clasped
tightly in either fist he sat in the middle of the floor
viewing the world in general, and Aunt Charity in
particular, with the suspicion of a financier. On her
side, suspicion was equally apparent.</p>

<p>“Fo’ de Lawd!” she said, and swept another
half yard, then stopped and viewed the intruder.
“Fo’ de Lawd!” she said again.</p>

<p>Sammy heard her and clasped his pennies tighter;
he read enmity in her eye and doubted. Aunt
Charity swept harder, her broom approaching the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
rear end of Sammy’s calico petticoat. “Git up, yo’
white trash, yo’,” she commanded, using the broom
to emphasize her order.</p>

<p>“Won’t!” wailed Sammy, “won’t! Shan’t have
my pennies!”</p>

<p>“Git up!” said Aunt Charity; “w’at yo’ heah for,
ennyway?”</p>

<p>“Yow!” yelled Sammy, wriggling along before the
broom and weeping.</p>

<p>On this scene entered Caleb Trench, grave, somewhat
weary, and with a new stern look that came
from a night’s wrestle with his own will. “What’s
all this, Aunt Charity?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t noffin,” said she aggressively; “I’se
sweepin’. I ain’t doin’ noffin an’ I ain’t gwine ter do
noffin to dat pore white trash.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you will,” said Caleb calmly; “you’ll give
him a bath and put some decent clothes on him.”</p>

<p>“N-o-o-o-o-o!” shrieked Sammy.</p>

<p>“’Deed I ain’t!” retorted Aunt Charity, with indignation.
“Ain’t dat Jean Bartlett’s chile?”</p>

<p>Trench nodded, looking from the old black woman
to the small aggressive bundle on the floor. Aunt
Charity tossed her head. “I ain’t gwine ter touch
him!”</p>

<p>A sudden fierce light shone in Caleb’s gray eyes,
a light that had a peculiarly quelling effect on the
beholder. Aunt Charity met it and cowered, clasping
her broom. “You’ll do what I say,” he replied,
without raising his voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“Fo’ de Lawd!” gasped Aunt Charity and whimpered;
“yo’ sho ain’t gwine ter keep dat chile heah?”</p>

<p>“And why not?” asked Caleb.</p>

<p>“Lawsy me, suh, ain’t yo’ gwine ter know w’at
folks’ll say? Dere’s gwine ter be a talkation.”</p>

<p>“Very likely, poor little devil!” Caleb retorted
grimly, “and your tongue to help it, but you’d
better hold it, Charity; you’re here to do what I
want—or to go elsewhere, see?”</p>

<p>“Yass, suh,” she replied hastily, “I’se gwine ter
do it, but I sure wishes yo’d let me take de chile
where he b’longs.”</p>

<p>“Where he belongs?” Caleb turned sharply.</p>

<p>“I ain’t sayin’,” cried Aunt Charity, thoroughly
frightened, “I ain’t saying—” Then she stopped
with her mouth open, for she had seen the figure in
the outer room that Caleb did not see.</p>

<p>Her look made him turn, however, to come face to
face with Jacob Eaton. He went out and closed the
door on the inner office sharply, not conscious that
Aunt Charity promptly dropped on her knees and
put her eye to the keyhole.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the two men measured each other with
peculiar enmity. Jacob thrust his hands into his
pockets and stood smiling, a smooth face but not a
pleasant one.</p>

<p>“I came to see you on a matter of business,” he
drawled, “but I’m afraid I disturb you.” He had
seen the scene in the inner room.</p>

<p>Caleb’s height was greater than his, and he looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
down at him with an inscrutable face; his temper
was quick, but he had the rare advantage of not
showing it.</p>

<p>“I am quite at leisure,” he said coldly, without the
slightest attempt at courtesy.</p>

<p>“I had the pleasure of reading your Cresset speech,”
said Jacob amusedly, “and I regret that I didn’t
hear it. I congratulate you, it was excellent reading.”</p>

<p>Trench looked at him keenly. “You didn’t come
here this morning to tell me that,” he said. “Come,
Mr. Eaton, what is it?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Jacob, still smiling, “I didn’t come for
that, you’re right. I came to make a business
proposition.”</p>

<p>There was a pause, and Trench made no reply.
Jacob began to find, instead, that his silence was a
peculiar and compelling weapon.</p>

<p>“You have made me the butt of your speeches,”
he continued, with his first touch of anger, “and your
attacks are chiefly aimed at the Land Company of
which I am the president. I suppose you are fully
aware of this?”</p>

<p>Caleb smiled involuntarily. “I could not be unaware,”
he observed.</p>

<p>“Then, perhaps, you are not unaware of what I
came for,” Jacob said.</p>

<p>“Possibly,” replied Trench, folding his arms and
leaning back against the wall, and studying Eaton
with a coolly indifferent scrutiny that brought the
color to Jacob’s face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“Ah, you have probably been expecting my visit?”
he said; “in other words, I suppose you’ve had an
object in stirring up this excitement, in directing
this attack upon me.”</p>

<p>“I have undoubtedly had an object,” Caleb Trench
replied, after a moment’s silence.</p>

<p>Jacob’s smile was a sneer. “We’re business men,
Mr. Trench,” he said; “I’m here this morning to
know the size of that object.”</p>

<p>Caleb moved slightly, but his arms were still folded
on his breast and he still leant against the wall; his
cool, unwinking gaze began to dash Eaton’s composure;
he could not be the finished and superior
gentleman he thought himself, under those relentless
eyes. He shifted his own position restlessly, drawing
nearer to his adversary.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said, “name your price.”</p>

<p>“My what?” demanded Trench.</p>

<p>“Your price,” Eaton sneered openly, his smooth
face crimson. In some way, to his own consciousness,
he seemed to be shrinking into insignificance
before the other man’s strong personality, his force,
his coolness.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose, because I have sold goods and
handled merchandise, that I am also on a level with
my trade?” Caleb asked coolly, so coolly that Jacob
was blinded to his peril.</p>

<p>“You are a trader,” said he bitingly, “a petty
tradesman and a petty politician; as such you have
your price.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>Caleb turned his face full toward him, and suddenly
Eaton realized the terrible light in his eyes.
“You lie,” he said slowly, deliberately, each word
like a slap in the face; “you are a liar.”</p>

<p>Jacob sprang at him, fury in his own face, and
prudence gone. But as he sprang Trench met him
with a blow straight from the shoulder. It caught
Eaton fairly and sent him sprawling, full length on
the floor.</p>

<p>“By the Lord Harry, you got it, Jacob!” cried
Judge Hollis from the door, where he had appeared
unheard.</p>

<p>As Jacob rose foaming, Caleb saw Aaron Todd’s
head behind the judge, and after him Peter Mahan.</p>

<p>There was no time to speak. Eaton flew at him
again, his head down, and for the second time Caleb
landed him on his back. Then the judge intervened.</p>

<p>“That’s enough,” he said dryly. “I reckon he
needed it, but he’s got it. Get up, Jacob, and keep
quiet.”</p>

<p>But Jacob would not; he got up to his feet again
and made a rush forward, only to find himself clasped
tight in Aaron Todd’s strong arms.</p>

<p>“Be quiet,” said Todd, “you’ll go down again like
a sack of salt, you idiot! You’re too full of booze
to risk a blow on your solar plexis.”</p>

<p>Eaton swore. “Let me go,” he said, “do you think
I’ll take it from that fellow? You’re a prize-fighter!”
he added between his teeth, lowering at Trench, and
wriggling helplessly in Aaron’s arms, “you’re a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
common prize-fighter; if you were a gentleman you’d
settle it with pistols!”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut!” said the judge.</p>

<p>“I will, if you like,” said Caleb coolly, his own
wrath cooled by victory.</p>

<p>Jacob’s eyes flashed; he was a noted shot. “I’ll
send some one to you later,” he said, the perspiration
standing out on his forehead, as he wrenched himself
from Todd’s arms.</p>

<p>“I’ve a mind to report you both to Judge Ladd,”
said Judge Hollis, but his fiery old soul loved the
smoke of battle.</p>

<p>Jacob, panting and disheveled, reached for his
hat. “It will be to-morrow,” he said, “and with
pistols—if you consent.”</p>

<p>Caleb looked at Todd and Mahan. “Will you
represent me, gentlemen?” he asked quietly, something
like a glint of humor in his eyes.</p>

<p>Todd nodded, and Peter Mahan, a keen-visaged
Irish Yankee, beamed. To his soul a battle was the
essence of life, and a duel was not unreasonable west
of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>“Folly,” said Judge Hollis, secretly exultant,
“rotten folly; let it drop.”</p>

<p>Jacob turned at the door, his face livid. “Not
till I’ve sent him to hell,” he said, and walked out.</p>

<p>The judge brought his fist down on his knee. “By
the Lord Harry,” he said, “it was this day twenty-odd
years ago that Yarnall shot Jacob’s father.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t shoot Jacob,” said Caleb dryly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>Judge Hollis turned quickly. “What do you
mean?” he began, but was interrupted.</p>

<p>The door between the rooms opened suddenly, after
much restless but unnoticed wriggling of the knob,
and Sammy, in his plaid petticoat and his brass-buttoned
jacket, came in on wobbly legs. He stopped
abruptly and viewed the group, finger in mouth.</p>

<p>“My God, what’s that?” exclaimed Judge Hollis
blankly.</p>

<p>Caleb laughed. “My ward,” he said, and then he
looked up and met three pairs of curious eyes. “It’s
Jean Bartlett’s child,” he explained simply; “she
died last night, and Dr. Cheyney threatened the
Foundling Asylum, so I just brought the kid here;
there’s room.”</p>

<p>Judge Hollis leaned forward, both hands on his
knees, and viewed the child. “What did you do it
for, Caleb?” he asked, in the midst of the pause.</p>

<p>“Heaven knows!” said Caleb, smiling, as he filled
his pipe. “I fancy because the poor little devil had
no home, and I’ve known what it was to want one.”</p>

<p>The judge rubbed his chin. “I’m beat!” he said.</p>

<p>The other two men looked on silently while Caleb
lit his pipe. Sammy picked up the judge’s cane from
the floor and tried slowly and solemnly to swallow
the gold knob on the top of it. The judge sank
slowly back into his chair, the old worn leather
chair. “And there’ll be a duel to-morrow!” he remarked;
then, looking at the child, he added feelingly,
“It beats the band!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE time for the duel was an hour before sunrise
the following day, and to Caleb Trench,
the Quaker, it was a gross absurdity. He
had knocked down Jacob Eaton as he would have
knocked down any man who insulted him, and he
would have fought Jacob with his fists, but to shoot
him down in cold blood was another matter; not
that Trench was over merciful toward a man like
Eaton, nor that he lacked the rancor, for an insult
lingers in the blood like slow poison.</p>

<p>Eaton had selected two young men from the city,
and the cartel had been delivered with all the care
and joy of an unusual entertainment. To Aaron
Todd, the farmer, it was a matter as ridiculous as it
was to Trench, though he could understand two men
drawing their weapons on each other in a moment of
disagreement. But Peter Mahan loved it as dearly
as did Willis Broughton, a grand-nephew, by the
way, of old Judge Hollis. The place chosen was
Little Neck Meadow, and the seconds made their
arrangements without any personal qualms. A fight,
after all, in that broad southwestern country was like
the salt on a man’s meat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the news that Caleb Trench had taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
in Jean Bartlett’s child dropped like a stone in a still
pool, sending the ripples of gossip eddying into wider
circles until the edges of the puddle broke in muddy
waves, for no one had ever really known who was the
father of Jean’s boy. So, before Caleb rose at daybreak,
to go to Little Neck Meadow, his adoption of
Sammy was as famous as his Cresset speech, and as
likely to bear unexpected fruits.</p>

<p>Old Judge Hollis had remonstrated against both
the child and the duel, but not so warmly against the
last as the first, and when he went away there was a
new look in his eyes. After all, what manner of man
was the shopkeeping lawyer of the Cross-Roads?
The judge shook his head, wondering; wondering,
also, that he loved him, for he did. The power of
Caleb Trench lay deeper than the judge’s plummet,
and, perhaps, it was that which lent the sudden
sweetness to his rare smile.</p>

<p>But there was no smile on Caleb’s face when he
went out, in the white mist of the morning, to fight
Jacob Eaton with pistols. He took the woodland road
on foot, alone, for he had sent his strangely assorted
seconds ahead of him. As he walked he was chiefly
aware of the soft beauty of the morning under the
trees, and he caught the keen glint of light on the
slender stem of a silver birch that stood at the head
of the path, and he heard the chirp of a song-sparrow.
A scarlet hooded woodpecker was climbing the trunk
of the tall hickory as he passed, and a ground squirrel
dashed across the trail. Caleb walked on, thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
a little of the possibility of death, and a great deal of
the gross incongruity of his act with his life and his
parentage. Through the soft light he seemed to see
his mother’s face, and the miracle of her love touched
him again. At heart he was simple, as all great
natures are, and tender; he could not have left Jean
Bartlett’s child in the woodbox. Yet he had no
mind to show that side of his nature, for he was shy
in his feelings, and he had borne the hurt of solitude
and neglect long and in silence; silence is a habit,
too, and bears fruit.</p>

<p>He walked slowly, looking through the trees at the
river which, now before sunrise, was the color of lead,
with a few ghostly lily-pads floating at its edges.
Beyond, he saw the high swamp grass that fringed
the edge of the delta; below lay Little Neck Meadow.
The other thought that haunted him, the picture of
Diana in the old leather chair beside his own hearthstone,
with the kindling glow of the wood fire on her
face, he thrust resolutely aside. After all, he was
nothing to Diana but the petty tradesman of Eshcol,
and now—if she knew—the intending murderer
of her kinsman. Yet it was Diana who walked before
him along the narrowing path. Thus do our emotions
play us tricks to our undoing, even in life’s most
vital moments.</p>

<p>But to the group waiting in the meadow, Caleb
Trench appeared as unmoved as stone. He was
prompt to the moment and accepted their arrangements
without a question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>Afterwards Aaron Todd told the story of the duel
at the tavern. Eaton and his seconds were in faultless
attire and eager for the fray. At the last moment
Todd had sent for Dr. Cheyney; his early arrival
meant an explosion against dueling, and no one
thought of waiting for him except Peter Mahan.</p>

<p>It ended in the two taking their places just as the
whole eastern sky ran into molten gold; it lacked
but a few moments, therefore, of sunrise, and there
was still a light mist.</p>

<p>Jacob Eaton, who was a noted shot, had been
drinking the night before, against the best efforts of
his friends. Trench stood like a pillar of stone. The
word was given, and both men raised their weapons.
Jacob fired and missed, then Caleb very deliberately
fired in the air. He had never even glanced at his
challenger. It was at this that Jacob Eaton lost his
temper and his wits and fired again, deliberately
attempting to shoot down his enemy. The bullet
went through Caleb’s left arm, missing his heart, and
Willis Broughton threw himself upon Eaton and
disarmed him.</p>

<p>When Dr. Cheyney came, Caleb had tied up his
own arm with Todd’s help, and was the calmest person
there. Eaton was hustled off the field by his
seconds, and the story—told a hundred ways—was
thrown into the campaign.</p>

<p>Old Dr. Cheyney drove Caleb home. “I reckon
the fool killer wasn’t out this morning,” he remarked
dryly, as he set him down before the office door, “or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
else he only winged you out of compassion. Caleb
Trench, for a man of common horse sense, you can be
the biggest fool west of the Mississippi. Adopted
Sammy, I suppose?” he added, cocking an eyebrow
aggressively.</p>

<p>Trench smiled. “Might as well,” he said.</p>

<p>“Precisely,” said the doctor, “if you want anything
more, let me know. I’ve got one old rooster
and a gobbler, that’s tough enough to be Job’s.
G’long, Henk!”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“I &#160;TELL you, David Royall, I can’t understand
I how you ever let that man come to your house,”
Mrs. Eaton said; “a common man in the first
place, and now—why, there can’t be any doubt at
all about Jean Bartlett! Hasn’t he got the child?”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall tilted his chair against the pillar
of the veranda and looked at her mildly. “That’s
where the doubt comes in, Jinny,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand you!” she retorted tartly,
dropping a stitch in her crocheting and struggling
blindly to pick it up. “I can’t in the least understand
your doubts—it’s obvious.”</p>

<p>“Which?” said the colonel, “the doubt or
Sammy?”</p>

<p>“Both!” said she.</p>

<p>“Well, Dr. Cheyney told me about it,” said the
colonel, “and I’m not sure that I believe all the other
things I hear. Give him the benefit of the doubt,
Jinny.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any doubt,” declared Mrs. Eaton;
“everybody says he’s the father of that child.”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall shook his head slowly. “It isn’t
like the male critter, Jinny,” he argued mildly, “to
take in the child; he’d most likely ship it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“Some women do that!” said Mrs. Eaton sharply,
shutting her thin lips.</p>

<p>The colonel turned a terrible face upon her.
“Jinny!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Eaton reddened and her hands shook, but she
went on without regarding his anger. “At least,
he’s the father of the Cresset speech, you’ll admit
that, and, if you please, here is this duel with Jacob—with
my son!”</p>

<p>“I believe Jacob was the challenger,” said Colonel
Royall.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t stand being insulted by such trash!”
said the indignant mother.</p>

<p>The colonel smiled broadly. “Come, Jinny, why
did he go there?”</p>

<p>“How should I know?” she retorted hotly; “some
political reason, of course, and Trench took advantage
of it, as a common man would.”</p>

<p>The colonel began to whittle a stick, man’s resource
from time immemorial. “Jinny,” he said,
“you’re the greatest partisan on earth; if you could
lead a political party you’d cover your antagonist
with confusion. When I see Jacob beating his head
against a wall I always remember he’s your son.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Eaton’s face relaxed a little. “Jacob takes
after my family,” she admitted, smiling; “he’s like
them in looks and he has all their charm.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you say yours, Jinny?” asked the
colonel, twinkling.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you half appreciate that,” she replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
with a touch of coquetry; “if you did, you
wouldn’t quarrel with me about Caleb Trench.”</p>

<p>“Do I?” said the colonel.</p>

<p>She let her crochet work drop in her lap and looked
at him attentively. “Do you mean to say you agree
with me?” she demanded.</p>

<p>The colonel laughed. “I’m not a violent man,
Jinny; since the war I’ve been a man of peace.
I’m not sure that I’ve got all the faith I ought to
have in these young iconoclasts.”</p>

<p>“Faith in that man!” Mrs. Eaton threw up her
hands. “If you had, David, I wouldn’t have any
in you!”</p>

<p>“Your conversation has rather led me to assume
that you had lost faith in my opinions,” he retorted,
amused.</p>

<p>“Well, sometimes, Cousin David, I think you’re
too willing to have the wool combed over your eyes!”
she said severely; “you’re so broad-minded, I suppose,
that you don’t think enough of the natural
prejudices of our own class.”</p>

<p>“Well, Jinny,” said the colonel dryly, “I’m a
little tired of our class.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Eaton raised her head to reply with indignation,
but utterance was suspended by Diana’s approach.
Her appearance always had the effect of
breaking off a conversation in the middle. She was
still a vision in pink muslin, with a wide straw hat
trimmed with roses. She swept out, fresh and sweet
and buoyant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“What are you two quarreling about?” she asked.
“I can’t leave you alone together any more; you fight
like game cocks. Of course it’s politics or social customs;
you haven’t got to religion yet, thank heaven!
When you do I shall have to send for the bishop.”</p>

<p>“It’s about that wretched man,” said Mrs. Eaton
fretfully. “I told David that he ought not to be
received here!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the colonel thoughtfully, “I’m not
sure he could be after this fight with Jacob; blood’s
thicker than water. But do you know, Jinny, I
don’t believe he’ll come?”</p>

<p>“Come!” cried Mrs. Eaton; “dear me, do you
imagine that a poor creature like that would lose the
chance?”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall smiled whimsically. “Jinny,”
said he, “your grandfather made his money selling
molasses in New Orleans.”</p>

<p>She gazed at him coldly. “It was wholesale,” she
said, with withering contempt.</p>

<p>The colonel shook with silent laughter.</p>

<p>All this time Diana had not opened her lips; she
stepped down from the piazza into the grass now and
unfurled her parasol.</p>

<p>“I hope you’re not going to make my unfortunate
grandfather a reason for inviting Caleb Trench here,”
said Mrs. Eaton bitingly, her eyes fixed on the
colonel’s flushed face.</p>

<p>“Cousin Jinny, he won’t come,” said Diana
suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>Both her father and Mrs. Eaton looked at her
astonished. “How do you know?” the latter asked
unconvinced.</p>

<p>“I asked him,” said Diana, and blushed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eaton was amazed. “You asked that man—that
person—and he refused your invitation?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Diana, scarlet now.</p>

<p>Her elderly cousin dropped her hands helplessly in
her lap. “Diana Royall, I’m ashamed of you!”</p>

<p>“I was ashamed of myself,” said Diana.</p>

<p>The colonel rubbed the back of his head thoughtfully.
“I reckon he had a reason, Di,” he said at
last.</p>

<p>“I have a reason for not asking him again,” replied
his daughter.</p>

<p>“Thank heaven!” ejaculated Mrs. Eaton devoutly.</p>

<p>The girl turned away and walked slowly across the
lawn. Two of the setters followed her half-way, but,
unencouraged, fell back lazily to lie in the cool grass.
As she went the murmur of indignant voices died
away, and she passed into the cool shadow of the
horse-chestnuts. Her face still burned with the blush
of vexation that Mrs. Eaton had summoned, and her
heart beat a little faster at the thought that she had
never asked any man to accept their hospitality before
in vain. It was preposterous and rude, yet, in
her heart, she respected Caleb Trench for refusing it.
Even at Kitty Broughton’s ball he had been accepted
only on tolerance and because of Judge Hollis. She
had seen him slighted, and then the prejudice had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
been against his poor little shop at the village Cross-Roads
and his black Republicanism, in a section that
was rankly Democratic. Now they had a greater
cause, the Cresset speech, the attacks upon Eaton,
the duel at Little Neck Meadow—of which no one
could get the truth, for no one knew socially Peter
Mahan or Aaron Todd—and last of all the scandal
of the child. The story of poor Jean Bartlett had
passed from lip to lip now that Sammy played on the
door-step of the most unique figure in local politics.</p>

<p>Gossips had promptly decided that Sammy was
Caleb’s child, and Jean’s had been a peculiarly sad
case. The story lost nothing in transmission, and
Diana tried not to recall details as she walked. Why
should she? The man was nothing to her! Her
father did not believe all he heard, and neither did
she, but she was more tormented than if she had believed
the worst. Certainty carries healing in its
wings; doubt is more cruel than a whip of scorpions.
She had tried to understand the man and she could
not; one thing contradicted another, but he was
strong, his figure loomed above the others, and the
storm was gathering about it, as the clouds sweep
around the loftiest peak.</p>

<p>The hottest contest for years was brewing in the
conventions, and it was known—and well-known—that
Caleb Trench had an immense influence with the
largest element of the party. He was convinced that
Aylett’s government was weak and permeated with
corruption, and he was making his conviction public,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
with a force and certainty that were bewildering far
older politicians. In fact, the man was no politician
at all; he was a born reformer, and he was making
himself felt.</p>

<p>Diana, too, had felt his force and resented it. She
resented also his duel with her cousin. The cheap
sensationalism of a duel irritated her, and she did not
place the whole blame upon Jacob, for she knew—Aunt
Charity had spread it—that Caleb had knocked
Jacob down. She was ashamed that she almost
tingled with joy at the thought of him towering in
wrath over Jacob, for she could divine the insulting
tone that must have provoked him beyond endurance.
She could divine it, but she would not accept it.
Jacob was her own relation, and Jacob had been
knocked down. It was maddening from that point
of view, and Diana felt that nothing but blood could
have atoned to her for being laid in the dust. Yet
she thrilled at the thought that Caleb Trench had
dealt the blow, that the son of the Philadelphia
Quaker was a man. Thus contradictory is the heart
of woman!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, she had left the confines of Broad
Acres and was walking slowly up the trail to Angel
Pass. Not far away was the spot where she had
stood and talked with Caleb in the sweet twilight.
Below her, as the path climbed, was the long slope
of rolling meadows which lay between this spot and
Paradise Ridge. Around her the tree trunks stood in
serried ranks, and here and there, where the wild<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
grapevines hung in long festoons, she noticed the
tight clusters of green grapes. She wished devoutly
that she could think of something beside the slightly
awkward figure, the sharp lines of the clean-cut face,
as it had looked in the twilight. Since then they had
met more than once, but it was that picture of him
which haunted her, and she was scarcely startled
when she turned the corner by the pines and saw
him ahead of her with Shot.</p>

<p>He heard her footstep, and when she would have
turned to avoid him, he prevented it by facing about
and greeting her. Both were conscious of constraint.
Jacob Eaton’s bullet had not broken the bone of his
arm, but the arm was still bandaged under the sleeve
and stiff, and the fact of the duel seemed to materialize
between them. The other thought, the thought
of Jean Bartlett and her child, sprang up unbidden in
her heart, and she was woman enough to wince. A
torrent of feeling swept through her like a whirlpool,
and she would not have told what it was, or whence
it came. Her face crimsoned, and unconsciously she
drew back. Something in his face, in the compelling
light in his eyes, made her catch her breath. On his
side, he saw only reluctance and repulsion, and mistook
it for rebuke. He remembered that report said
she was to marry Jacob Eaton, and he had knocked
Jacob Eaton down. He would have been less than
human had he not experienced then one instant of
unholy joy to think that he had done it. Neither
spoke for a full moment, then he did ceremoniously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“Pardon me,” he said, “I ought not to intrude upon
you, Miss Royall. I see that I am doubly unfortunate,
both unexpected and unwelcome.”</p>

<p>Diana struggled with herself. “Unexpected, certainly,”
she said, conscious that it was a falsehood,
for had he not haunted her? “but unwelcome—why?
This is a public place, Mr. Trench.”</p>

<p>He smiled bitterly. “Fairly answered,” he said;
“you can be cruel, Miss Royall. I am aware that to
you—I merely cumber the earth.”</p>

<p>“I believe you refused an invitation to come to
our house,” she retorted.</p>

<p>He swung around in the path, facing her fully, and
she felt his determination, with almost a thrill of pride
in him.</p>

<p>“Miss Royall—I have no right to say a word,” he
said, “but do you think—for one instant—that if
you gave that invitation sincerely I would refuse it?
You know I would not. I would come with all
my heart. But—because I know how absurd it is,
because I know how you feel, I will not. I am too
proud to be your unwelcome guest. Yet I am not
too proud to speak to-night. God knows I wish I
could kill it in my heart, but I will say it. I love
you.”</p>

<p>Diana stretched her hand out involuntarily and
rested it against the slender stem of a young pine;
she clung to it to feel reality, for the world seemed to
be turning around. She never opened her lips and
she dared not look at him; she had met that light in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
his eyes once and dared not raise hers. If she had!
But she did not—and he went on.</p>

<p>“It is madness, I know it,” he said bitterly, “and
if I could strangle it—as a living thing—I would,
but I cannot. I love you and have loved you from
the first. It would be mockery indeed to accept your
chary invitations. I suppose you think that it is an
insult for me to speak to you, but”—he smiled bitterly—“to
myself I should seem a little less than a
man if I did not. However, I beg your pardon, if it
seems an affront.”</p>

<p>Diana tried twice to speak before she could utter a
word. Then she seemed to hear her own voice quite
calm. “I do not consider it so. I—I am sorry.”</p>

<p>He turned away. “Thank you,” he said abruptly,
“I would like to be, at least, your friend.” He added
this with a reluctance that told of a bitter struggle
with his own pride.</p>

<p>Diana held out her hand with a gesture as sweet as
it was involuntary. “You are,” she said, quite simply.
“Mr. Trench, I—I take it as an honor.”</p>

<p>He held her hand, looking at her with an amazement
that made her blush deeply. She felt her emotion
stifling her, tears were rushing to her eyes. How
dreadful it was for him to force her into this position.
They were as widely sundered as the poles, and yet
she no sooner met his eyes than she wavered and
began to yield; she snatched her hand away.</p>

<p>“Thank you a thousand times for saying that!” he
murmured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>She fled; she was half-way up the path; the sunshine
and the breeze swept down from Angel Pass.
She was conscious of him still standing there and
turned and looked back. “Good-bye!” she called
softly over her shoulder, and was gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was in the heat of midsummer that Judge Hollis
walked into Caleb’s inner office.</p>

<p>“Caleb,” he said, “I’m hanged if I haven’t
changed the color of my coat and come to your opinion.
After this I’m for Yarnall.”</p>

<p>Caleb smiled, leaning back wearily in his chair and
glancing unconsciously at Sammy, the innocent cause
of much scandal in Eshcol, who lay asleep beside
Shot on the floor, his chubby arms around the dog’s
neck.</p>

<p>The smoke of the two great conventions was still in
the air. Two weeks before the Republicans had
peacefully and hopelessly nominated Peter Mahan
for Governor, and the Democrats, after a deadlock
and a disgraceful collapse of the opposition, had nominated
Aylett. Every politician in the State knew
that it had cost the Eaton faction nearly two hundred
thousand dollars. There had been a storm of
indignation, and Yarnall had come back and put his
case in the hands of the Republican lawyer, Caleb
Trench! The indignation and chagrin of the older
Democratic lawyers added nothing to the beauty of
the situation, but Caleb had grasped it silently and
was dealing with it. In ten days he had forced the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
Grand Jury to indict both Aylett and Eaton, along
with half a dozen of their lieutenants, and the hour
of the great trial was approaching. Feeling ran so
high that there were threats on both sides, and it was
a common saying that men went armed.</p>

<p>The judge banged his broad-brimmed Panama
down on the table. “Caleb,” he said grimly, “how
much more packing is there to come out of this?”</p>

<p>This time Trench laughed. “Not a great deal,
Judge,” he replied easily, “I’ve got most of it out.
We’re going to prove both our cases against Aylett
and Eaton. Aylett’s used more money, but Eaton
has intimidated. The convention was packed. They
threw in Eaton as a third candidate to split Yarnall’s
strength; they knew all the investors in his get-rich-quick
schemes would follow him, and they’d been
warned to do it. I’ve got the evidence. Of course,
when Yarnall got them deadlocked, even with that
break in his strength, Eaton withdrew and, throwing
all his votes suddenly to Aylett, nominated him on
the fifth ballot.”</p>

<p>The judge scowled at him from under his heavy
brows. “What’s this about the Todd test case?”
he growled.</p>

<p>“Aaron Todd got hold of one of the delegates and
found out that he’d been offered a bribe by Eaton.
Todd suggested to him to take it and get the matter
witnessed; it was done and will be used in court.”</p>

<p>“Damned shabby!” said the judge.</p>

<p>Caleb smiled. “I call it a harder name, Judge,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
he said simply. “I shan’t use it, but, after all, I’m
only the junior counsel.”</p>

<p>The old man looked at him over his spectacles. “I
understand that Yarnall has picked you out as a kind
of red flag to the bull, and means to wave you in
Eaton’s face.”</p>

<p>“So he does, I fancy,” said Trench, “but we’re
going to call Judge Hollis.”</p>

<p>The judge stared; a dull red crept up to his hair.
He had felt the slight when Caleb was chosen, and he
suspected that the younger man knew it. Yet the
temptation to be in the thick of the fray was like the
taste of fine wine in the mouth of the thirsty. “By
gum, sir,” he said, “I don’t believe I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you will,” said Trench decisively, “we need
you. Besides, Mr. Yarnall has written a formal request
to you: we want influential men on our side.
We’ve got a clear case, but we want the people to
understand that we’re not demagogues. And”—Trench
suddenly used all his persuasive powers,
which were great—“Judge, I lack your experience.”</p>

<p>It was a touch of modesty that went to the judge’s
heart. He took Diana’s chair—Caleb always called
it that in his heart—and they fell to discussing the
situation and the most salient points in the case, for
it had divided the State and it would affect the election
of the United States Senator later.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sammy slept, with his yellow curls
mingling with Shot’s yellow hair; they were boon
companions and no one troubled the child. Once or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
twice Zeb Bartlett had come, bent on making trouble,
but he had been sent away. Sammy found his new
home wholly desirable; Aunt Charity was even growing
fond of him, and Dr. Cheyney brought him toys.
But between Caleb and himself there was a complete
understanding; the child followed him about as patiently
as did Shot, and as unquestioningly. In some
mysterious way he had grasped the meaning of his
adoption, and he understood the silent, preoccupied
man as well as the dog did. With both it was an instinct
that recognized kindness and protection. Left
to amuse himself from babyhood, Sammy made little
trouble. He would lie on his stomach by the hour
working a toy train of cars to and fro in one spot, and
he had destroyed only one brief which had been left
within his reach.</p>

<p>Judge Hollis talked for over an hour, going over the
case which was to come up before Judge Ladd in ten
days. He saw that Trench had prepared every inch
of it, and that he was chiefly wanted as a notable
figurehead, yet he was nothing loath to be the figurehead.
When he had fully grasped the evidence, and
saw before him one of the biggest cases on record in
the State courts, he threw back his head like an old
war-horse snuffing the battle afar.</p>

<p>“By the Lord Harry!” he said, slapping his knee,
“we’ll whip them to kingdom come, Caleb, and shear
the sheep at that!” Then his eye suddenly lighted
on the sleeping child, and his shaggy brows dropped;
he stooped over and looked at him, thrusting out his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
underlip. “Caleb,” he said, “send that brat to St.
Vincent’s.”</p>

<p>Caleb, who was making notes, looked up. “Why?”
he asked dryly.</p>

<p>The judge growled. “You’re a tarnation fool!”
he replied. “I’m not asking whose child he is! What
I say is—send him packing.”</p>

<p>Caleb turned and glanced at the child, and the
judge, watching him, was astonished at the softening
of his face. “Poor little devil,” he said quietly,
“I fancy he’ll stay as long as I do, Judge Hollis.
I’ve had no home, I’ve been in desperate straits,
now I’ve got this roof. That dog was a stray, so is
the child—they’re welcome.”</p>

<p>The judge was silent for a long while. Then he
drew a pattern on the floor with his cane. “Caleb,”
he said, more kindly, “that kid has raised Cain for
you. Jinny Eaton is blowing the news to the four
winds of heaven, and everybody believes it. You
might as well hang an albatross around your neck.
If you’re not the child’s father—by gum, sir, you
might as well be!”</p>

<p>Caleb set his teeth hard, and the light came into
his eyes,—the light that some people dreaded.
“Judge,” he said sternly, “I’m accountable to no
man, neither am I a coward. Mrs. Eaton may say
what she pleases; being a woman, she is beyond my
reach.”</p>

<p>The judge got up and drove his hat down hard on
his head with his favorite gesture, as though he put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
the lid on to suppress the impending explosion. “By
gum!” he said, and walked out.</p>

<p>That evening Caleb found Sammy asleep in the old
leather armchair with his yellow head on the arm,
and he snatched him out of it, in spite of Sammy’s
vigorous protests, and put him to bed. He never
thought that Diana’s arms might have held the child
as pitifully, for Diana had a noble heart.</p>

<p>Then followed the greatest case of disputed nomination
ever contested west of the Mississippi. The
old court-house was packed to its limit, and there were
one or two hardy spirits who climbed the tree outside
and listened through the open windows. Feeling ran
so high when Aaron Todd testified that there was a
column of militia in Townhouse Square. It was hot;
they were cutting oats in the fields and the rye was
nearly ripe, while all the grapes were coloring like
new wine.</p>

<p>Aylett and Eaton fought step by step, inch by
inch, and the court sat from early morning until
candle-light, yet it was three weeks before it went to
the jury, and they had been twenty-nine days getting
that jury!</p>

<p>Two brilliant lawyers from the East spoke for
the defense, and Judge Hollis opened for the plaintiff.
It was afternoon; the judge had made an able
if somewhat grandiloquent plea, and the court-house
was so thronged that men stood on the window-sills,
shutting out the view from the trees. Caleb
Trench closed the case for Yarnall, and men, remembering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
his Cresset speech, had refused to leave the
court-room for dinner, fearful of losing their seats—or
their standing room. Eaton alone left abruptly
when he began to speak.</p>

<p>Trench had a peculiarly rich voice, low-toned but
singularly clear; he used no gestures, and his attitudes
were always easy and unembarrassed when he
forgot himself in his work. His personality counted,
but it was neither that nor his eloquence which held
the court-room spellbound; it was the force of his
logic, the power to get down to the root of things, to
tear away all illusions and show them the machine
as it had existed for nearly twenty years. Incidentally,
as it seemed to some, he showed them, beyond
all doubt, the fraud and intimidation that had renominated
Governor Aylett.</p>

<p>The lights were burning in the court-room and
outside in the square when Judge Ladd charged the
jury. Not a man left his place as the jurors filed out,
except Trench. He went to send a message to Aunt
Charity about his two waifs at home, who must not
go supperless. He was still out, and Judge Hollis
sent for him hastily when the jury came back in
twenty minutes. They brought in a verdict of guilty
as indicted; the illegal use of money, corruption in
office, and intimidation were the charges against
Aylett and Eaton and ten others.</p>

<p>At half-past nine that night the militia had to
charge in the court-house square to disperse the
crowd.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">COLONEL ROYALL and Diana drove into
town in the morning; it was a long drive
from Eshcol, and the road led past Paradise
Ridge. Diana, from her side of the carriage, noticed
the little cabin where Jean Bartlett had died, and
saw the shambling figure of Zeb leaning against the
door-post. Zeb was talking to a well-dressed man
whose back was toward her. A low-growing horse-chestnut
partly hid his figure, but afterwards she
remembered a curious familiarity about it. At the
time her heart was bitter. She had heard nothing
but Mrs. Eaton’s version of the scandal of Paradise
Ridge for a month, and once, when she drove past
the Cross-Roads, she had seen Sammy’s chubby
figure sprawling under the trees beside Caleb Trench’s
office.</p>

<p>If he were the child’s father, he had certainly taken
up the burden squarely. Diana pushed all thought
of it out of her mind by main force, yet two hours
later it would come back. She remembered, too,
that meeting on the trail, and her heart quaked. In
some mysterious, unfathomable way the man loomed
up before her and mastered her will; she could not
cast him out, and she stormed against him and against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
herself. Outwardly she was listening to Colonel
Royall. At heart, too, she was deeply concerned
about her father; the colonel was failing, he had been
failing ever since spring set in. All her life Diana
had felt that, in spite of their devotion to each other,
there was a door shut between them, she had never
had his full confidence. Yet, she could not tell
how she knew this, what delicate intuition revealed
the fact of his reticence. She had twice
asked Dr. Cheyney what secret trouble her father
had, and the old man had looked guilty, even when
he denied all knowledge. Diana felt the presence of
grief, and she had assumed that it was especially
poignant at the season when he kept the anniversary
of his wife’s death. Yet, lately, she wondered that
he had never taken her to her mother’s grave. Mrs.
Royall had died when Diana was three years old,
and was buried in Virginia. More than this Diana
had never known, but she did know that her room
at Broad Acres had been locked the day of her death
and that no one ever went there except her father
and the old negro woman who kept it spotless and
“just as Miss Letty left it.”</p>

<p>Neither Colonel Royall nor old Judy ever vouchsafed
any explanation of this room, its quaintly
beautiful furniture and the apparently unchanging
spotlessness of the muslin curtains and the white
valance of the mahogany four-poster. Once, when
she was a child, Diana had crept in there and hidden
under the bed, but hearing the key turn in the lock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
when old Judy left the room, her small heart had
quaked with fear and she had remained crouching
in a corner, still under the bed, not daring to look
out lest she should indeed see a beautiful and ghostly
lady seated at the polished toilet-table, or hear her
step upon the floor. She stayed there three hours,
then terror and loneliness prevailed and she fancied
she did hear something; it was, perhaps, the rustle
of wings, for she had been told that angels had wings,
and if her mamma were dead she was, of course, an
angel. The rustle, therefore, of imaginary wings was
more than Diana could bear, and she lifted up her
voice and wept. They had been searching the house
for her, and it was her father who drew her out from
under the bed and carried her, weeping, to the nursery.
Then he spoke briefly but terribly to the mammy in
charge, and Diana never crept under the white valance
again.</p>

<p>She remembered that scene to-day as the carriage
drove on under the tall shade trees, and she
remembered that Colonel Royall had never looked
so ill at this time of the year since the time when he
was stricken with fever in midsummer, when she was
barely fifteen. Then he had been out of his head for
three days and she had heard him call some one
“Letty!” and then cry out: “God forgive me—there
is the child!” He had been eighteen months
recovering, and she saw presages of illness in his
face; his eyes were resting sadly and absently, too,
on the familiar landscape. Diana winced, again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
conscious of the shut door. It is hard to wait on at
the threshold of the heart we love.</p>

<p>They were crossing the bridge when a long silence
was broken. Below them some negroes were chanting
in a flatboat, and their voices were beautiful.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="first">“Away down South in de fields of cotton,</div>
<div class="verse">Cinnamon seed and sandy bottom,</div>
<div class="indent">Look away, look away,</div>
<div class="indent">Look away, look away!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Pa,” said Diana suddenly, “do you believe in
the verdict?”</p>

<p>The colonel took off his hat and pushed back his
thick white hair. “I reckon I’ve got to, Di,” he
replied reluctantly.</p>

<p>“Then you think Jacob is a bully and a fraud,”
said Diana, with the unsparing frankness of youth.</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid!” said the colonel gently.</p>

<p>“I thought you wanted me to marry him,” she
pursued, victory in her eye.</p>

<p>The colonel reddened. “Diana,” he said, “I don’t
want you to marry anybody.”</p>

<p>She smiled. “Thank you,” she said; “after all,
the verdict has done some good in this State, Colonel
Royall.”</p>

<p>They were at the court-house door now, and there
was a crowd in the square. The colonel got down
and helped out Diana, and they walked into the
arched entrance of the basement together. “I didn’t
want to leave you out there to be stared at by that
mob,” said the colonel; “people seem to know us at
a glance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>Diana laughed softly. “Of course no one would
remember you,” she said maliciously; “they’re looking
at my new hat.”</p>

<p>“I reckon they are,” said her father dryly; “we’ll
have to find a place to hide it in.”</p>

<p>As he spoke they passed the last doorkeeper, and
walked down the stone-paved corridor toward the
elevator. It was absolutely still. On the left hand
was a small room with one large window looking out
into the court where a tree of heaven was growing.
It had sprung from a seed and no one had cut it down.
The window was barred, but the cool air of the court
came in, for the sash was open. It was a room that
they called “the cage,” because prisoners waited
there to be summoned to the court-room to hear the
verdict, but Colonel Royall did not know this. There
were a narrow lounge in it, two chairs and a table.</p>

<p>“Wait here,” he said to Diana, “I shan’t be ten
minutes. I want to see Judge Ladd, and I know
where he is up-stairs. Court has adjourned for
luncheon, and you won’t be disturbed.”</p>

<p>Diana went in obediently and sat down in the chair
by the window. She could see nothing but the court
enclosed on four sides by the old brick building, and
shaded in the centre by the slender tree of heaven.
There was no possible view of the street from this
room. Opposite the door was the blank wall of the
hall; on the other side of that wall were the rooms
of the Registrar of Wills and the Probate Court.
Outside the door a spiral iron staircase ascended to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
the offices of the State’s attorney; around the corner
was the elevator and to this Colonel Royall went.</p>

<p>Diana leaned back in her chair and surveyed the
chill little room; on the walls were written various
reflections of waiting prisoners. None were as eloquent
as Sir Walter Raleigh’s message to the world,
but several meant the same thing in less heroic English.
The colonel had been gone ten minutes, and his
daughter was watching the branches of the tree as
they stirred slightly, as if touched by some tremulous
breath, for no wind could reach them here.</p>

<p>It was then that she heard a quick step in the corridor
and knew it intuitively. She was not surprised
when Caleb Trench stopped involuntarily at the door.
They had scarcely met in two months, but the color
rushed into her face; she seemed to see him again
in the spring woods, though now the hedgerows were
showing goldenrod. Involuntarily, too, she rose
and they stood facing each other. She tried to speak
naturally, but nothing but a platitude came to her lips.</p>

<p>“I congratulate you,” she said foolishly, “on your
victory.”</p>

<p>“Miss Royall, I am sorry that everything I do
seems like a personal attack upon your people,” he
replied at once, and he had never appeared to better
advantage; “like the spiteful revenge of a foolish
duellist, a sensational politician. Will you do me
the justice to believe that my position is painful?”</p>

<p>Diana looked at him and hated herself because her
breath came so short; was she afraid of him? Perish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
the thought! “I always try to be just,” she began
with dignity, and then finished lamely, “of course
we are a prejudiced people at Eshcol.”</p>

<p>“You are like people everywhere,” he replied;
“we all have our prejudices. I wish mine were less.
There is one thing I would like to say to you, Miss
Royall—” He stopped abruptly, and raised his
head. Their eyes met, and Diana knew that he was
thinking of Jean Bartlett; she turned crimson.</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>“I shall not say it,” he said, and his strong face
saddened. What right had he to thrust his confidence
upon her? “You are waiting for your father?”
he added; “may I not escort you to another room?
This—is not suitable.” He wanted to add that he
was amazed at the colonel for leaving her there; he
did not yet fully understand the old man’s simplicity.</p>

<p>“I prefer to stay here,” Diana replied, a little
coldly; “my father knows I am here.”</p>

<p>It was Caleb’s turn to color. “I beg your pardon.”
He stopped again, and then turned and looked out
of the window. “I fear I have lost even your friendship
now,” he said bitterly.</p>

<p>She did not reply at once; she was trying to discipline
herself, and in the pause both heard the great
clock in the tower strike one.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I thank you for offering to find
me a pleasanter place to wait in,” Diana said, with
an effort at lightness. “It is a little dreary, but I’m
sure my father must be coming and—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>She stopped with a little cry of surprise, for there
was suddenly the sharp sound of a pistol shot, followed
instantly by a second. The reports came from
the other side of the hall, and were followed by a
tumult in the street.</p>

<p>“What can it be?” she cried, in sudden terror for
her father.</p>

<p>Caleb Trench swung around from the window with
an awakening of every sense that made him seem
a tremendous vital force. He divined a tragedy.
Afterwards the girl remembered his face and was
amazed at the fact that she had obeyed him like a
child.</p>

<p>“Wait here!” he exclaimed, “your father is safe.
I will see what it is. On no account leave this room
now—promise me!”</p>

<p>She faltered. “I promise,” she said, and he was
gone.</p>

<p>It seemed five minutes; it was in reality only ten
seconds since the shots were fired. Meanwhile, there
was a tumult without, the shouting of men and the
rush of many feet. Diana stood still, trembling,
her hands clasped tightly together. Even afar off
the voice of the mob is a fearsome thing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MEANWHILE Colonel Royall and Judge Ladd
had been in consultation in the judge’s private
office, behind the court-room.</p>

<p>Governor Aylett and Jacob Eaton had definitely
decided to appeal the case, and a slight discrepancy
in the stenographer’s notes had made it necessary
for Colonel Royall to review a part of his testimony.
Having disposed of these technicalities, the colonel
found it difficult to depart. He and Judge Ladd had
been boys together; they met infrequently, and the
present situation was interesting.</p>

<p>The colonel stood with his thumbs inserted in
the armholes of his marseilles waistcoat, his hat
on the back of his head, and a placid smile on his
lips. The judge sat at his table, smoking a huge
cigar and meditating. In his heart he rather resented
the rapid rise of the unknown young lawyer;
he had worked his own way up inch by inch, and
he had no confidence in meteoric performances, and
said so.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the colonel slowly, “I reckon I’d
better not say anything, Tommy, I’m on the wrong
side of the fence; I’m Jacob’s cousin, though I feel
like his grandfather.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>The judge knocked the ashes from his cigar and
said nothing. It was not in his province to discuss
the defendant just then.</p>

<p>“I’d give something handsome,” the colonel continued,
“to know how in mischief Trench got such
a hold on the backwoodsmen. Todd follows him about
like a lapdog, too, yet he doesn’t hesitate to condemn
Todd’s methods of getting evidence.”</p>

<p>The judge grunted. “Heard about personal magnetism,
haven’t you?” he asked tartly; “that’s what
he’s got. I sat up there on the bench and listened
when he began to address the jury. I’ve heard hundreds
do it; I know the ropes. Well, sir, he took me
in; I thought he was going to fall flat. He began
as cool and slow and prosy as the worst old drone
we’ve got; then he went on. By George, David, I
was spellbound. I clean forgot where I was; I sat
and gaped like a ninny! He cut right through their
evidence; he knocked their witnesses out one by one;
he tore their logic to pieces, and then he closed.
There wasn’t a shred of ’em left. I charged the
jury? Yes, hang it! But I knew what the verdict
would be, so did every man-jack in the court-room.”</p>

<p>“Remarkable!” exclaimed the colonel. “I admit
it, Tommy; I was there.”</p>

<p>“Then why the devil didn’t you say so?” snapped
the judge.</p>

<p>“Thought you saw me; I was in the front row,”
replied the colonel, with a broad smile.</p>

<p>“See you?” retorted the judge fiercely, “see you?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
I didn’t see a damned thing but that young shyster,
and before he got through I could have hugged him,
yes, sir, hugged him for making that speech.”</p>

<p>The colonel shook with laughter. “Tommy,” he
began.</p>

<p>But just then there were two sharp reports of a
pistol near at hand, followed by a tumult in the
street below. Both men hurried to the window, but
the jutting wing of the court-room hid the center of
interest, and all they could see was the crowd of
human beings huddled and packed in the narrow
entrance of the alley that led to the Criminal Court-room.
There were confused cries and shoutings,
and almost immediately the gong of the emergency
ambulance.</p>

<p>“Some one’s been shot,” said Judge Ladd coolly;
then he turned from the window and halted with his
finger on the bell.</p>

<p>The door from the court-room had opened abruptly
and Judge Hollis came in. Both Ladd and Colonel
Royall faced him in some anxiety; there was an
electric current of excitement in the air.</p>

<p>“Yarnall has been shot dead,” he said briefly.</p>

<p>“My God!” exclaimed Judge Ladd.</p>

<p>Colonel Royall said nothing, but turned white.</p>

<p>“Have they got the assassin?” the judge demanded,
recovering his self-control.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Judge Hollis, a singular expression
on his face. “No, the shot was fired from the window
of the court-room; the room was empty, everybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
at dinner, and the windows open; the pistol is on the
floor, two chambers empty. Only one man was seen
in the window, a negro, and he has escaped.”</p>

<p>“A negro?” the judge’s brows came down, “no,
no!” Then he stopped abruptly, and added, after a
moment, “Was he recognized?”</p>

<p>“They say it was Juniper,” said Judge Hollis
stolidly.</p>

<p>“Wild nonsense!” exclaimed Colonel Royall.</p>

<p>Hollis nodded. His hat was planted firmly on his
head and he stood like a rock. “Nevertheless, there’s
wild talk of lynching. Ladd, I think we’d better get
the lieutenant-governor to call out the militia.”</p>

<p>The storm in the street below rose and fell, like a
hurricane catching its breath. Colonel Royall looked
out of the window; the crowd in the alley had overflowed
into the square, and swollen there to overflow
again in living rivulets into every side street. He
looked down on a living seething mass of human
beings. The sunlight was vivid white; the heat
seemed to palpitate in the square; low guttural cries
came up. The names of Yarnall and Eaton caught
his ear. He remembered suddenly the significance
of Judge Hollis’ glance at him, and he did not need
to remember the blood feud. Suddenly he saw the
crowd give way a little before a file of mounted
police, but it closed again sullenly, gathered the
little group of officers into its bosom and waited.</p>

<p>The old man had seen many a fierce fight, he had
a scar that he had received at the Battle of the Wilderness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
he had a gunshot wound at Gettysburg, but he
felt that here was the grimmest of all revelations, the
slipping of the leash, the wild thing escaping from its
cage, the mob! The low fierce hum of anger came
up and filled their ears, he heard the voices behind
him, the rushing feet of incoming messengers, the
news of the lieutenant-governor’s call for the militia.
Then he suddenly remembered Diana, and plunged
abruptly down-stairs.</p>

<p>She had been waiting all this while alone in the
lower room, yet, before the colonel got there, Caleb
Trench came back. He had just told her what had
happened when her father appeared.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” said the colonel, “I clean forgot
you!”</p>

<p>Diana was very pale, but she smiled. “I know
it,” she said, glancing at Caleb. “Once father got
excited at the races at Lexington and when some one
asked him his name, he couldn’t remember it. He
paid a darkey a quarter to go and ask Judge Hollis
who he was! Colonel Royall, I must go home.”</p>

<p>“So you must,” agreed the colonel, “but, my dear,
the crowd is—er—is rather noisy.”</p>

<p>“It’s a riot, isn’t it?” asked Diana, listening.</p>

<p>They heard, even then, the voice of it shake the
still hot air. Then, quite suddenly, a bugle sounded
sweetly, clearly.</p>

<p>“The militia,” said the colonel, in a tone of relief.
“I reckon we can go home now.”</p>

<p>“You can go by the back way,” said Caleb quietly;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
“stay here a moment and I’ll see that some one gets
your carriage through the inner gate. The troops
will drive the mob out of the square.”</p>

<p>He had started to leave the room when Colonel
Royall spoke. “Is—is Yarnall really quite dead?”</p>

<p>“Killed instantly,” said Caleb, and went out.</p>

<p>Diana covered her face with her hands; she had
been braving it out before him. “Oh, pa!” she
cried, “how dreadful! I was almost frightened to
death and—and I always thought I was brave.”</p>

<p>“You are,” said the colonel fondly; “I was a brute
to forget you—but—well, Diana, it was tremendously
shocking.”</p>

<p>Diana’s face grew whiter. “Pa,” she said suddenly,
“where—where is Jacob?”</p>

<p>The colonel understood. “God knows!” he said,
“but, Diana, he wasn’t in the court-room!”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank God!” she said.</p>

<p>It was then that Caleb came back, and she noticed
how pale he looked and how worn, for the long weeks
of preparation for the trial and the final ordeal had
worn him to the bone. “The carriage is waiting,” he
said simply, and made a movement, slight but definite,
toward Diana. But she had taken her father’s arm.
The colonel thanked the younger man heartily, yet
his manner did not exactly convey an invitation.
Caleb stood aside, therefore, to let them pass. At the
door, Diana stopped her father with a slight pressure
on his arm, and held out her hand.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” she said quietly, “and thank you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>Caleb watched them disappear down the corridor
to the rear entrance where two policemen were on
guard. Then he went out, bareheaded, on the front
steps and glanced over the heads of the troopers
sitting like statues on their horses in front of the
court-house. Yarnall’s body had been carried in on
a stretcher, and a detachment of the governor’s
guard filled the main entrance. Beyond the long
files of soldiers the streets were packed with men
and women and even children. No one was speaking
now, no sounds were heard; there was, instead, a
fearful pause, a silence that seemed to Trench more
dreadful than tumult. He stood an instant looking
at the scene, strangely touched by it, strangely moved,
too, at the thought of the strong man who had been
laid low and whose life was snapped at one flash,
one single missile. Death stood there in the open
court.</p>

<p>Then some one cried out shrilly that there was
Caleb Trench, the counsel for Yarnall, the dead
man’s victorious defender, and at the cry a cheer
went up, deep-throated, fierce, a signal for riot. The
silence was gone; the crowd broke, rushed forward,
hurled itself against the line of fixed bayonets, crying
for the assassin.</p>

<p>A bugle sounded again. There was a long wavering
flash of steel, as the troopers charged amid cries and
threats and flying missiles. A moment of pandemonium
and again the masses fell away and the
cordon of steel closed in about the square.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>At the first sound of his name Caleb Trench had
gone back into the court-house. On the main staircase
he saw Governor Aylett, Jacob Eaton and a
group of lawyers and officers of the militia. He
passed them silently and went up-stairs. Outside
the court-room door was a guard of police. The door
of Judge Ladd’s inner office was open and he saw that
it was crowded with attorneys and officials. Judge
Hollis came out and laid his hand on Caleb’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“My boy,” he said, “this is the worst day’s work
that has ever been done here, and they want to lay
it on a poor nigger.”</p>

<p>“I know,” replied Caleb, “he was the only one seen
at the window.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Judge Hollis, “but, by the Lord
Harry, I’d give something handsome to know—who
was behind Juniper!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was almost morning when Caleb Trench reached
home, and the low building where he had his
office—he had closed his shop a month before—was
dark and cheerless.</p>

<p>The news of the shooting of Yarnall, and the subsequent
rioting, had traveled and multiplied like a
reed blown upon the winds of heaven. Aunt Charity
had heard it and forgotten her charge. Shot was on
guard before the dead ashes in the kitchen stove, and
Sammy lay asleep in his little bed in the adjoining
room. Fortunately the child seemed to have slept
through the hours that had elapsed since the old
woman’s departure. Caleb found some cold supper
set out for him, in a cheerless fashion, and shared it
with Shot, strangely beset, all the while, with the
thought of the charm and comfort of Broad Acres, as
it had been revealed to him in his infrequent visits.</p>

<p>Diana’s presence in the basement of the court-house
had changed his day for him, and he recalled
every expression of her charming face, the swift shyness
of her glance, when his own must have been too
eloquent, and every gesture and movement during
their interview. At the same time he reflected that
nothing could have been more unusual than her presence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
there in the prisoner’s cage, as it was called, and
he was aware of a feeling of relief that no one had
found them there together at a time when his smallest
action was likely to be a matter of common public
interest.</p>

<p>But predominant, even over these thoughts, was
the new aspect of affairs. Yarnall was dead, and as a
factor in the gubernatorial fight he was personally
removed, but his tragic death was likely to be as
potent as his presence. He had already proved to
the satisfaction of one jury that his defeat in the convention
was due solely to Aylett’s fraud and to Eaton’s
hatred, and it was improbable that, even in a violently
partisan community, justice should not be
done at last. Besides, the frightful manner of his
taking off called aloud for expiation. The tumult at
the court-house testified to the passions that were
stirred; the old feud between the Eatons and the
Yarnalls awoke, and men remembered, and related,
how Yarnall’s father had shot Jacob Eaton’s father.
A shiver of apprehension ran through the herded
humanity in squares and alleys; superstition stirred.
Was this the requital? The old doctrine, an eye for
an eye, a tooth for a tooth,—how it still appeals to
the savage in men’s blood. The crowd pressed in
around the court-house where Yarnall’s body lay in
state, and outside, in a stiff cordon, stood sentries;
the setting sun flashed upon their bayonets as the
long tense day wore to its close.</p>

<p>In the court-house Caleb Trench had worked tediously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
through the evening with Judge Ladd and Judge
Hollis. A thousand matters came up, a thousand
details had to be disposed of, and when he returned
home at midnight he was too exhausted physically
and mentally to grapple long with a problem at once
tiresome and apparently insoluble. He dispatched
his supper, therefore, and putting out the light went
to his own room. But, before he could undress, Shot
uttered a sharp warning bark, and Caleb went back
to the kitchen carrying a light, for the dog was perfectly
trained and not given to false alarms.</p>

<p>His master found him with his nose to the crack of
the outer door, and the slow but friendly movement
of his tail that announced an acquaintance. At the
same time there was a low knock at the door.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” Caleb demanded, setting his
light on the table and, at the same time, preparing to
unfasten the lock.</p>

<p>“Fo’ de Lawd, Marse Trench, let me in!” cried a
muffled voice from the outside, and, as Caleb opened
the door, Juniper nearly fell across the room.</p>

<p>“Shet de doah, massa,” he cried, “lock it; dey’s
after me!”</p>

<p>It was intensely dark, being just about half an
hour before dawn, and the scent of morning was in the
air. It seemed to Caleb, as he glanced out, that the
darkness had a softly dense effect, almost as if it
actually had a substance; he could not see ten yards
from the threshold and the silence was ominous. He
shut the door and locked it and drew down the shade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
over the kitchen window; afterwards he remembered
this and wondered if it were some impulse of secretiveness
that prompted a movement that he had not
considered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Juniper had fallen together in a miserable
huddled heap by the stove. His head was
buried in his arms and he was sobbing in terror,
long-drawn shivering sobs that seemed to tear his
very heart out. Trench stood looking at him, knowing
fully what suspicions were against the black, and the
terrible threats that had filled the town, seething
as it was with excitement and a natural hatred of
the race. That Juniper had plotted Yarnall’s death
was an absurdity to Trench’s mind; that he might
have been the tool of another was barely possible.
On the other hand, his chances of justice from the
mob were too small to be considered. His very presence
under any man’s roof was a danger as poignant
as pestilence. This last thought, however, had no
weight with Caleb Trench. The stray dog guarded
his hearth, the nameless child lay asleep in the next
room, and now the hunted negro cowered before him.
It was characteristic of the man that the personal
side of it, the interpretation that might be put upon
his conduct, never entered his calculations. Instead,
he looked long and sternly at the negro.</p>

<p>“Juniper,” he said, “you were the only person
seen in the window of the court-house before
the assassination of Mr. Yarnall. Were you alone
there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>Juniper cowered lower in his seat. “Fo’ de Lawd,
Marse Trench, I can’t tell you!” he sobbed.</p>

<p>“Who was in the room with you?” asked Trench
sharply.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell!” the negro whimpered; “I don’
know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you do,” said Caleb, “and you will be forced
to tell it in court. Probably, before you go to court,
if the people catch you,” he added cold-bloodedly.</p>

<p>Juniper fell on his knees; it seemed as if his face
had turned lead color instead of brown, and his teeth
chattered. “Dey’s gwine ter lynch me!” he sobbed,
“an’ fo’ de Lawd, massa, I ain’t done it!”</p>

<p>Caleb looked at him unmoved. “If you know
who did it, and do not tell, you are what they
call in law an accessory after the fact, and you can be
punished.”</p>

<p>Juniper shook from head to foot. “Marse Caleb,”
he said, with sudden solemnity, “de Lawd made us
both, de white an’ de black, I ain’t gwine ter b’lieb
dat He’ll ferget me bekase I’se black! I ain’t murdered
no one.”</p>

<p>Caleb regarded him in silence; the force and eloquence
of Juniper’s simple plea carried its own conviction.
Yet, he knew that the negro could name
the murderer and was afraid to. There was a tense
moment, then far off a sound, awful in the darkness
of early morning,—the swift galloping of horses on
the hard highroad.</p>

<p>“Dey’s comin’,” said Juniper in a dry whisper, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
lips twisting; “dey’s comin’ ter kill me—de Lawd
hab mercy on my soul!”</p>

<p>Nearer drew the sound of horses’ feet, nearer the
swift and awful death. Caleb Trench blew out his
light; through the window crevices showed faint
gray streaks. Shot was standing up now, growling.
Caleb sent him into the room with little Sammy, and
shut the door on them. Then he took the almost
senseless negro by the collar and dragged him to the
stairs.</p>

<p>“Go up!” he ordered sternly; “go to the attic
and drag up the ladder after you.”</p>

<p>Juniper clung to him. “Save me!” he sobbed, “I
ain’t dun it; I ain’t murdered him!”</p>

<p>“Go!” ordered Caleb sharply.</p>

<p>Already there was a summons at his door, and he
heard the trample of the horses. Juniper went crawling
up the stairs and disappeared into the darkness
above. Caleb went to his desk and took down the
telephone receiver, got a reply and sent a brief message;
then he quietly put his pistol in his pocket and
went deliberately to the front door and threw it open.
As he did it some one cut the telephone connection,
but it was too late. In the brief interval since he had
admitted the fugitive, day had dawned in the far
East, and the first light seemed to touch the world
with the whiteness of wood ashes; even the cottonwoods
showed weirdly across the road. All around
the house were mounted men, and nearly every man
wore a black mask. The sight was gruesome, but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
stirred something like wrath in Caleb’s heart; how
many men were here to murder one poor frightened
creature, with the intellect of a child and the soul of
a savage!</p>

<p>Caleb’s large figure seemed to fill the door, as he
stood with folded arms and looked out into the gray
morning, unmoved as he would look some day into
the Valley of the Shadow. Of physical cowardice he
knew nothing, of moral weakness still less; he had
the heroic obstinacy of an isolated soul. It cost him
nothing to be courageous, because he had never known
fear. Unconsciously, he was a born fighter; the scent
of battle was breath to his nostrils. He looked over
the masked faces with kindling eyes; here and there
he recognized a man and named him, to the mask’s
infinite dismay.</p>

<p>“Your visit is a little early, gentlemen,” he said
quietly, “but I am at home.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Trench, we want that nigger!” they
yelled back.</p>

<p>“You mean Juniper?” said Caleb coolly. “Well,
you won’t get him from me.”</p>

<p>“We know he’s about here!” was the angry retort,
“and we’ll have him, d’ye hear?”</p>

<p>“I hear,” said Caleb, slipping his hand into his
pocket. “You can search the woods; there are about
three miles of them behind me, besides the highroad
to Paradise Ridge.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to search your house,” replied the
leader; “that’s what we’re going to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“Are you?” said Caleb, in his usual tone, his eyes
traveling over their heads, through the ghostly outlines
of the cottonwoods, past the tallest pine to the
brightening eastern sky.</p>

<p>Something in his aspect, something which is always
present in supreme courage,—that impalpable but
strenuous thing which quells the hearts of men before
a leader,—quenched their fury.</p>

<p>“Look here, Caleb Trench, you were Yarnall’s lawyer;
you ain’t in the damned Eaton mess. Where’s
that Eaton nigger?”</p>

<p>Caleb’s hand closed on the handle of his revolver in
his pocket. “Gentlemen,” he said quietly, “I happen to
know that the negro, Juniper, did not shoot Mr. Yarnall,
and if I know where he is now I will not tell you.”</p>

<p>“By God, you shall!” yelled the nearest rioter,
swinging forward with uplifted fist.</p>

<p>He swung almost on the muzzle of Caleb’s revolver.</p>

<p>“One step farther and you’re a dead man,” Trench
said.</p>

<p>The would-be lyncher lurched backward. In the
white light of dawn Caleb’s gaunt figure loomed, his
stern face showed its harshest lines, and there was
fire in his eyes. A stone flew and struck him a little
below the shoulder, another rattled on the shingles
beside the door; there was a low ominous roar from
the mob; right and left men were dismounting,
and horses plunged and neighed.</p>

<p>“Give up that damned nigger or die yourself!”
was the cry, taken up and echoed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>Within the house Shot began to bark furiously, and
there was suddenly the shrill crying of a child.</p>

<p>“Jean Bartlett!” some one shouted.</p>

<p>“Ay, let’s hang him, too—for her sake!”</p>

<p>There were cheers and hisses. Caleb neither moved
nor shut the door.</p>

<p>“Give us that nigger!” they howled, crowding
up.</p>

<p>By a miracle, as it seemed, he had kept them about
three yards from the entrance in a semicircle, and here
they thronged now. From the first they had surrounded
the house, and the possibility of an entrance
being forced in the rear flashed upon Caleb. But he
counted a little on the curiosity that kept them hanging
on his movements, watching the leaders. He saw
at a glance that there was no real organization, that a
motley crowd had fallen in with the one popular idea
of lynching the negro offender, and that a breath of
real fear would dissolve them like the mists which
were rolling along the river bottoms.</p>

<p>“Where’s that nigger?” came the cry again, and
then: “It’s time you remembered Jean Bartlett!”</p>

<p>One of the leaders, a big man whom Caleb failed to
recognize, was still mounted. He rose in his stirrups.
“Hell!” he said, “he’s got the child; if he hadn’t,
I’d burn him out.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Caleb coolly, raising his hand to
command attention, “I will give the child to your
leader’s care if you wish to fire my house. I do not
want to be protected by the boy, nor by any false impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
that I am expiating an offense against Jean
Bartlett.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence again, then a solitary
cheer amid a storm of hisses. A tumult of shoutings
and blasphemies drowned all coherent speech.
Men struggled forward and stopped speechless, staring
at the unmoved figure in the door, and the grim
muzzle of his six-shooter. It was full day now, and
murder and riot by daylight are tremendous things;
they make the soul of the coward quake. There
were men here and there in the crowd who shivered,
and some never forgot it until their dying day.</p>

<p>“Give us the nigger!”</p>

<p>Caleb made no reply; his finger was on the trigger.
There was a wild shout and, as they broke and rushed,
Caleb fired. One man went down, another fell back,
the mob closed in, pandemonium reigned. Then there
was a warning cry from the rear, the clear note of a
bugle, the thunder of more horses’ hoofs, the flash of
bayonets, and a file of troopers charged down the long
lane; there was a volley, a flash of fire and smoke.
Men mounted and rode for life, and others fell beneath
the clubbed bayonets into the trampled dust.</p>

<p>In the doorway Caleb Trench stood, white and
disheveled, with blood on his forehead, but still
unharmed.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">COLONEL ROYALL was reading an extra edition
of the morning paper; it contained a full
account of the attempted lynching, and the
timely arrival of the militia. The colonel was smoking
a big cigar and the lines of his face were more
placid than they had been for a week, but his brow
clouded a little as he looked down the broad driveway
and saw Jacob Eaton approaching. Jacob, of
late, had been somewhat in the nature of a stormy
petrel. Nor did the colonel feel unlimited confidence
in the younger man’s judgment; he was beginning to
feel uneasy about certain large transactions which he
had trusted to Jacob’s management.</p>

<p>The situation, however, was uppermost in the
colonel’s mind? He dropped the paper across his
knee and knocked the ashes out of his cigar. Jacob’s
smooth good looks had never been more apparent
and he was dressed with his usual elaborate care.
Nothing could have sat on him more lightly than the
recent verdict, and the fact that he was out on bail.
Colonel Royall, who was mortified by it, looked at
him with a feeling of exasperation.</p>

<p>“Been in town?” he asked, after the exchange of
greetings, as Jacob ascended the piazza steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“All the morning,” he replied, sitting down on the
low balustrade and regarding the colonel from under
heavy eyelids.</p>

<p>“How is it? Quiet?” The colonel was always
sneakingly conscious of a despicable feeling of panic
when Jacob regarded him with that drooping but
stony stare.</p>

<p>“Militia is still out,” said Jacob calmly, “and if
the disturbances continue the governor threatens to
call on Colonel Ross for a company of regulars.”</p>

<p>“He’s nervous,” commented the colonel reflectively.
“I don’t wonder. How in the mischief did
Aylett happen to be near Yarnall?”</p>

<p>Jacob looked pensive. “I don’t know,” he said;
“I was in the rear corridor by the State’s Attorney’s
room. They say Aylett was crossing the quadrangle
just in front of Yarnall.”</p>

<p>The colonel smoked for a few moments in silence,
then he took his cigar from between his teeth. “What
were you doing in the corridor?” he asked pointedly.</p>

<p>Jacob took a cigarette out of his pocket and lit it.
“I was going to Colonel Coad’s office, and I was the
first to try to locate the shots outside the court-house.”</p>

<p>“I was in Judge Ladd’s room,” said Colonel Royall
deliberately, “and I reckon that was as near as I want
to be. I see by this”—he touched the paper with
his finger—“that Caleb Trench induced Juniper to
surrender to the authorities, and he says that he’s
sure he can prove the negro’s innocence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>Jacob laughed, showing his teeth unpleasantly.
“Probably he can,” he remarked; “he’s under
arrest himself.”</p>

<p>The colonel swung around in his chair. “Caleb
Trench? What for?”</p>

<p>“For the assassination of Yarnall.”</p>

<p>“By gum!” said the colonel in honest wrath,
“what rotten nonsense!”</p>

<p>Jacob said nothing; he continued to smoke his
cigarette.</p>

<p>The colonel slapped the paper down on his knee.
“When men’s blood is heated, they run wild,” he
said. “Why, Trench was Yarnall’s counsel; he’d
won the case for him—he—”</p>

<p>“Just so,” replied Jacob coolly; “you forget that
Aylett had insulted Trench twice in court, that he
despised him as heartily as I do and that Aylett was
almost beside Yarnall!”</p>

<p>The colonel pushed his hat back on his head and
thought. He knew that Eaton hated Trench, but his
mind did not embrace the enormity of a hatred that
could revel in such an accusation. “The charge
then must be that he meant to hit Aylett,” he
said, after a long moment, “and that makes him
take big risks. These Yankees aren’t good shots,
half of ’em.”</p>

<p>Jacob laughed unpleasantly. “Well, I reckon he
wasn’t,” he remarked, and as his thoughts went
back to a certain gray morning in Little Neck Meadow,
his face reddened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>The colonel wriggled uncomfortably in his chair.
“What did he want to shoot Aylett for?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>“You’ve forgotten, I suppose, that Aylett called
him a liar twice in court,” said Jacob dryly.</p>

<p>“He didn’t shoot you for a greater provocation,”
retorted the colonel bluntly.</p>

<p>“He was the only man found in the court-room
with the smoking weapon,” said Jacob. “Juniper
ran away, and he’s been protecting Juniper,—buying
him off from testifying, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand why either he or Juniper was
in the court-room,” declared the colonel, frowning.</p>

<p>“Had good reason to be,” replied Jacob tartly,
tossing his cigarette over the rail.</p>

<p>“See here, Jacob,” said the colonel solemnly, “I’m
an old man and your relation, and I feel free to give
you advice. You keep your oar out of it.”</p>

<p>Jacob laughed. “I’ve got to testify,” he drawled.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” exclaimed the colonel.</p>

<p>Then followed several moments of intense silence.</p>

<p>“Where’s Diana?” asked the young man at last,
rising and flipping some ashes off his coat.</p>

<p>“In the flower garden,” replied her father thoughtfully,
“she’s seeing to some plants for winter; I
reckon she won’t want you around.”</p>

<p>Jacob looked more agreeable. “I think I’ll go all
the same,” he said, strolling away.</p>

<p>The colonel leaned forward in his chair and called
after him. “Jacob, how about these stocks? I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
wanted to sell out at eight and three quarter
cents.”</p>

<p>Eaton paused reluctantly, his hands in his pockets.
“You can next week,” he said; “the market’s
slumped this. You’d better let me handle that deal
right through, Cousin David.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been doing it straight along,” said the
colonel. “I reckon I’d better wake up and remember
that I used to know something. I’m equal to
strong meats yet, Jacob, and you’ve been putting
me on pap.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right!” said Jacob. “I’ll sell the
shares out for you,” and he departed.</p>

<p>The colonel sat watching him. The old thought
that he would probably marry Diana no longer had
any attractions for him; he had lost confidence in
Jacob’s sleek complacence, and the recent testimony
in court had shaken it still more. Besides, he had a
fine pride of family, and the verdict against Jacob
had irritated and mortified him. Nothing was too
good for Diana, and the fact that there was the shadow
of a great sorrow upon her made her even dearer to
her father. He had never thought that she had more
than a passing fancy for Jacob, and lately he had
suspected that she disliked him. The colonel ruminated,
strumming on the piazza balustrade with absent
fingers. Before him the long slope of the lawn
was still as green as summer, but the horse-chestnut
burs were open and the glossy nuts fell with every
light breeze. Across the road a single gum tree waved
a branch of flame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>He was still sitting there when Kingdom-Come
brought out a mint julep and arranged it on the table
at his elbow.</p>

<p>The colonel glanced up, conscious that the negro
lingered. “What’s the matter, King?” he asked
good-humoredly.</p>

<p>“News from town, suh,” the black replied, flicking
some dust off the table with his napkin. “Dey’s
tried ter storm de jail, suh. De militia charged, an’
deyer’s been right smart shootin’.”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall looked out apprehensively over the
slope to the south which showed in the distance the
spires and roofs of the city. A blue fog of smoke
hung low over it and the horizon beyond had the
haze of autumn. “Bad news,” said he, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>“It suttinly am, suh,” agreed Kingdom-Come,
“an’ dey do say dat Aunt Charity ez gwine ter leave
Juniper now fo’ sho.”</p>

<p>“She’s left him at intervals for forty years,” said
the colonel, tasting his julep; “I reckon he can stand
it, King.”</p>

<p>The negro grinned. “I reckon so, suh,” he assented.
“Juniper dun said once dat he’d gib her her
fare ef she’d go by rail an’ stay away!”</p>

<p>Just then Miss Kitty Broughton stopped her pony
cart at the gate and came across the lawn. The
colonel rose ceremoniously and greeted her, hat in
hand.</p>

<p>“Where’s Diana?” Kitty asked eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“In the rose garden with Jacob, my dear,” said the
colonel.</p>

<p>Kitty made a grimace. “<i>Noblesse oblige</i>,” she said;
“I suppose I must stay here. Colonel, isn’t it all
dreadful? Grandfather can’t keep from swearing,
he isn’t respectable, and Aunt Sally has Sammy.”
Kitty blushed suddenly. “I took Shot, the dog, you
know; they won’t let Mr. Trench have bail.”</p>

<p>“It’s the most inexplicable thing I know of,” said
the colonel, stroking his white moustache. “Why
Caleb Trench should shoot his own client—”</p>

<p>Kitty stared. “Why, Colonel, you know, don’t
you, that the arrest was made on Jacob Eaton’s
affidavit?”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall leaned back in his chair, and Kitty
found his expression inexplicable. “How long have
you known this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Since morning,” said Kitty promptly. “Grandpa
told us; he’s furious, but he says it’s a good case.
It seems Mr. Eaton saw Mr. Trench first in the court-room.
The two shots were fired, you know, in quick
succession. Juniper was seen by some one at the
window just before; no one saw who fired the shots,
but Mr. Eaton met Caleb Trench leaving the room.
No one else was there, and Mr. Trench says that
Juniper did not fire the shots. Juniper is half dead
with fright, and in the jail hospital; he went out
of his head this morning when the mob tried to rush
the jail. It’s awful; they say six people were killed
and three wounded.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“Caleb Trench wounded two last night,” said the
colonel. He had the air of a man in a dream.</p>

<p>“They won’t die,” replied Kitty, cold-bloodedly,
“and it’s a good thing to stop these lynchers. Wasn’t
Mr. Trench grand? I’m dying to go and see him and
tell him how I admired the account of him facing the
mob. What does Di think?”</p>

<p>“She hasn’t said,” replied the colonel, suddenly
remembering that Diana’s silence was unusual. He
looked apprehensively toward the rose garden and
saw the flutter of a white dress through an opening
in the box hedge. “Kitty,” he added abruptly,
“you go over there and see Diana and ask her
yourself.”</p>

<p>“While Mr. Eaton’s there?” Kitty giggled. “I
couldn’t, Colonel Royall; he’d hate me.”</p>

<p>The colonel looked reflectively at the young girl
sitting in the big chair opposite. She was very pretty
and her smile was charming. “I don’t think he’d
hate you, my dear,” he remarked dryly, “and I know
Diana wants to see you.”</p>

<p>Kitty hesitated. “I don’t like to interrupt,” she
demurred.</p>

<p>“You won’t,” said the colonel, a little viciously.</p>

<p>Kitty rose and descended the steps to the lawn,
nothing loath; then she stopped and looked over her
shoulder. “Mr. Trench will be tried immediately,”
she said; “the Grand Jury indicted him this morning.”</p>

<p>The colonel’s frown of perplexity deepened. “I
call it indecent haste,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>“Grandpa is to defend him,” said Kitty, “and
we’re proud of him. I think Caleb Trench is a real
hero, Colonel Royall.”</p>

<p>The colonel sighed. “I wish Jacob was,” he
thought, but he did not speak.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JUDGE HOLLIS was writing in his office. He
had been writing five hours and the green shade
of his lamp was awry, while his briar-wood had
just gone out for the ninety-ninth time. Some one
knocked twice on the outer door before he noticed it.
Then he shouted: “Come in!”</p>

<p>After some fumbling with the lock the door opened,
and Zeb Bartlett’s shambling figure lurched into the
room. He came in boldly, but cowered as he met the
judge’s fierce expression. The old man swung around
in his chair and faced him, his great overhanging
brows drawn together over glowing eyes, and his lip
thrust out.</p>

<p>The boy was stricken speechless, and stood hat in
hand, feebly rubbing the back of his head. The judge,
who hated interruption and loathed incompetence,
scowled. “What d’ye want here?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Zeb wet his parched lips with his tongue. “I
want the law on him,” he mumbled; “I want the
law on him!”</p>

<p>“What in thunder are you mumbling about?”
demanded the old man impatiently; “some one stole
your wits?”</p>

<p>“It was him did my sister wrong,” Zeb said, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
tongue loosed between fear and hate; “it’s him, and
I want him punished—now they’ve got him!”</p>

<p>Judge Hollis threw the pen that he had been holding
suspended into the ink-well. “See here, Zeb,”
he said, “if you can tell us who ruined your poor
crazed sister, why, by the Lord Harry, I’d like to
punish him!”</p>

<p>Zeb looked cunning; he edged nearer to the desk.
“I can tell you,” he said, “I can tell you right cl’ar
off, but—I want him punished!”</p>

<p>“May be the worst we can do is to make him take
care of the child,” said Judge Hollis.</p>

<p>“That won’t do,” said Zeb, “that ain’t enough;
he left her to starve, and me to starve—she tole me
who it was!”</p>

<p>Judge Hollis was not without curiosity, but he
restrained it manfully. He even took his paper-cutter
and folded the paper before him in little plaits.
“Zeb,” he said, “it’s a rotten business, but the girl’s
dead and Caleb Trench has taken the child and—”</p>

<p>“It’s him, curse him, it’s him!” Zeb cried, shaking
his fist.</p>

<p>Judge Hollis dropped the paper-cutter and rose
from his chair, his great figure, in the long dark blue
coat, towering.</p>

<p>“How dare you say that?” he demanded, “you
cur—you skunk!”</p>

<p>But Zeb was ugly; he set his teeth, and his crazy
eyes flashed. “I tell you it’s him,” he cried; “ain’t
I said she tole me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“Damn you, I don’t believe you,” the judge
shouted; “it’s money you want, money!” He
grabbed the shaking boy by the nape of the neck, as
a dog takes a rat, and shook him. “You clear out,”
he raged, “and you keep your damned lying, dirty
tongue still!” and flung him out and locked the
door.</p>

<p>Then, panting slightly, he went back to his seat,
swung it to his desk again, rolled back his cuffs and
wiped the perspiration from his forehead. Then he
pulled his pen out of the ink-well and shook the surplus
ink over the floor and began to write; he wrote
two pages and dropped his pen. His head sank, his
big shoulders bowed over, he was lost in thought.
He thought there for an hour, while nothing stirred
except the mouse that was gnawing his old law-books
and had persistently evaded Miss Sarah’s
vigilance. Then the judge brought his great fist
down on his desk, and the ink-well danced, and the
pen rolled off.</p>

<p>“My God!” he exclaimed to himself, “I’ve loved
him like a son, the girl was treated like hell—it
can’t be true!”</p>

<p>He rose, jammed his hat down on his head and
walked out; he walked the streets for hours.</p>

<p>It was very late when he was admitted to the old
jail. It was past time to admit visitors, but the
judge was a privileged person. The warden gave
up his private room to him and sent for the prisoner.
The lamp burnt low on the desk, and the old judge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
sat before it, heavy with thought. He looked up
mechanically when Caleb came in with his quick
firm step and faced him. The two greeted each other
without words, and Caleb sat down, waiting. He
knew his visitor had something on his mind.</p>

<p>Judge Hollis looked at him, studying him, studying
the clear-cut lines, the hollowed cheeks, the
clear gray eyes, the chiseled lips,—not a handsome
face, but one of power. The sordid wretchedness of
the story, like a foul weed springing up to choke a
useful plant, struck him again with force and disgust.</p>

<p>“I’ve just seen Zeb Bartlett,” he said; “he’s
raving to punish the man who wronged his sister.
He says you did it!” The old man glared fiercely
at the young one.</p>

<p>Caleb’s expression was slightly weary, distinctly
disappointed: he had hoped for something of importance.
The story of Jean Bartlett was utterly
unimportant in his life. “I know it,” he said briefly;
“it is easy to accuse, more difficult to prove the
truth.”</p>

<p>The judge leaned forward, his clasped hands hanging
between his knees, his head lowered. “Caleb,”
he said, “maybe it’s not right to ask you, but, between
man and man, I’d like to know God’s truth.”</p>

<p>Caleb Trench returned the old man’s look calmly.
“Judge,” he said, “have you ever known me to
steal?”</p>

<p>The judge shook his head.</p>

<p>“Or to lie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>Again the judge dissented.</p>

<p>“Then why do you accuse me in your heart of
wronging a half-witted girl?” he asked coldly.</p>

<p>The judge rose from his chair and walked twice
across the room; then he stopped in front of the
younger man. “Caleb,” he said, “by the Lord
Harry, I’m plumb ashamed to ask you to forgive
me.”</p>

<p>Caleb smiled a little sadly. “Judge,” he said,
“there’s nothing to forgive. Without your friendship
I should have been a lost man. I understand.
Slander has a hundred tongues.”</p>

<p>“Zeb Bartlett is shouting the accusation to the
four winds of heaven, I presume,” said the judge,
“and there’s the child—you—”</p>

<p>“I’ve taken him,” said Caleb, “and I mean to
keep him. I’ve known poverty, I’ve known homelessness,
I’ve known slander; the kid has got to face
it all, and he won’t do it without one friend.”</p>

<p>The judge looked at him a long time, then he went
over and clapped his hand down on his shoulder.
“By the Lord Harry!” he said, “you’re a man, and
I respect you. Let them talk—to the devil!”</p>

<p>“Amen!” said Caleb Trench.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the case of the Commonwealth versus
Caleb Trench was called, it was found
necessary to convene the court in the
old criminal court-room in the northeast corner of the
quadrangle. The room from which Yarnall had
been shot, known as Criminal Court Number One,
was too open to the square, and too conveniently
located as a storm center. The old court-room facing
northeast was smaller, and so poorly lighted that
dull mornings it was necessary to burn lights on the
judge’s desk and at the recorder’s table. It opened
on the inner court, and the only thing seen from the
window was the tree of heaven, which was turning
a dingy yellow and dropping its frond-like leaves
into the court below. During half the trial Aaron
Todd’s son and another youngster sat in this tree
and peered in the windows, the room being too
crowded for admittance; but when Miss Royall
testified even the windows were so stuffed with
humanity that the two in the tree saw nothing, and
roosted in disappointment.</p>

<p>In the quadrangle before the court-house, and in
a hollow square around it, were the troops, through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
the whole trial, and after a while one got used to the
rattle of their guns as they changed at noon. Men
fought for places in the court-room, and the whole
left-hand side was packed solid with young and
pretty women. The figure of Caleb Trench, since
his famous Cresset speech, had loomed large on the
horizon, and the account of the frustrated lynching
added a thrilling touch of romance. Besides, Jacob
Eaton was to testify against him, and that alone
would have drawn an audience. The thrill of danger,
the clash of the sentry’s rifle in the quadrangle, the
constant dread of riots, added a piquancy to the
situation that was like a dash of fine old wine in a
<i>ragout</i>. The room was packed to suffocation, and
reporters for distant newspapers crowded the reporters’
table, for the case was likely to be of national
interest. The doors and the corridors were thronged,
and a long line waited admission on the staircase.
Some failed to get in the first or the second day, and
being desperate stayed all night outside, and so were
admitted on the third day.</p>

<p>Judge Hollis had charge of the defense, and it
was expected that he would ask a change of venue,
but he did not. Instead he tried to get a jury, using
all his privileges to challenge. It was almost impossible
to get an unbiased juror and, at the end of
a week, he had exhausted two panels and was on
another. On the fifteenth day he got a jury and
the public drew breath. Judge Ladd was on the
bench,—a fair but choleric man, and known to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
rather unfavorable to the prisoner. Bail had been
absolutely refused, and Caleb Trench shared the
fate of the other prisoners in the jail, except, indeed,
that he was doubly watched, for the tide of men’s
passions rose and fell. He had been almost a popular
idol; he was, therefore, doubly likely to be a
popular victim, and Aylett went far and wide declaring
that he believed the shot was intended for
him, and that Yarnall had suddenly passed between
him and the window at the fateful moment.</p>

<p>On the other hand Jacob Eaton spoke freely of
Jean Bartlett and her child. The scandal traveled
like a fire in prairie grass, and Jean, who had been
in life the Shameful Thing of Paradise Ridge, became
now a persecuted martyr, and Trench the monster
who had ruined her life. The fact that he had taken
the child, instead of being in his favor, recoiled
strongly against him. He was watched as he sat in
the prisoners’ dock, and every expression of his stern
and homely face was noted; the slight awkwardness
of his tall figure seemed more visible, and men were
even startled by his eyes. It may be added that the
women found them most interesting, especially when
that sudden light flashed into them that had cowed
so many of the weaker brethren. Like all strong,
blunt men, Caleb had made his enemies, and now,
in the hour of his need, they multiplied like flies.
Misfortune breeds such insects as readily as swamplands
breed mosquitoes.</p>

<p>“I’d be ashamed to say I knew that shyster,” one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
of the Eaton faction said in the crowded court-room
at noon recess, and Dr. Cheyney heard him.</p>

<p>The old man snorted. “I’m almighty glad he don’t
know you,” he said dryly.</p>

<p>The next day they began to take testimony.
Juniper, the one person who had been in the court-room
at the time of the assassination, could not be
called at once, as he was still in the hospital, but he
had made a deposition that he did not know who fired
the shots, that his back was turned and that when he
heard the reports he ran. This impossible statement
could not be shaken even by threats. Later, he would
go on the stand, but Judge Hollis had given up hope
of the truth; he believed, at heart, that Juniper was
crazed with fright. Had he been hired to fire the
shots? The judge could not believe it, for he felt
tolerably certain that Juniper would have hit nothing.</p>

<p>The general belief outside, however, was that Caleb
had used his opportunity well and threatened or bribed
the negro into making his remarkable affidavit. In
fact, Caleb was himself profoundly puzzled, yet the
testimony of Eaton, given clearly and apparently dispassionately,
was damaging. He had been in Colonel
Coad’s office, he was coming along the upper corridor,
heard the shots and ran to the court-room, reaching
the door immediately before Sergeant O’More of the
police; both men met Caleb Trench coming out of
the room, and on the floor, by the window, was
the revolver. No one else was in sight. Juniper’s
flight had been made at the first shot, and seven minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
only had elapsed before any one could reach the
court-room. Caleb Trench had been seen to enter the
building at twenty-five minutes to one o’clock, and
his time up to the assassination was unaccounted for.
He said that he had been in the basement of the building,
but his statement did not give any legitimate
reason for the length of time between his entrance
and his appearance in the court-room. It took, in
reality, just two minutes to reach the court-room
from the lower door by the staircase. Trench made
no explanation of the use of that twenty-five minutes,
even to his counsel. Judge Hollis stormed and grew
angry, but Caleb pointed out the fact that the pistol
was not his, and he could prove it; this made the
judge’s language absolutely profane. The obstinacy
of the prisoner resulted in a distinct collapse at that
point in the trial; it was evident that the time must
be accounted for, since the circumstantial evidence
was strong.</p>

<p>The public prosecutor, Colonel Coad, was pressing
in, scoring point by point, and Judge Hollis fought
and sparred and gave way, inwardly swearing because
he had to do so. Meanwhile, the prisoner was serene;
he took notes and tried to help his counsel, but he
showed no signs of trepidation and he would not
admit any use for that time in the basement of the
court-house. Judge Hollis could not, therefore, put
him on the stand on his own behalf, and the old man
grew purple with wrath.</p>

<p>“Look here, Mr. Trench,” he said, with bitter formality,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
“what damned crotchet have you got in your
head? What fool thing were you doing? Working a
penny-in-the-slot machine in the basement? Out
with it, or I walk out of this case.”</p>

<p>“And leave me to the tender mercies of my enemies,”
said Caleb quietly; “no, Judge, not yet! I
can’t see my way clear to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m darned if I see mine to defend you!”
snapped the judge.</p>

<p>They were in the prisoner’s cell at the jail, and
Caleb got up and went to the little barred window
which overlooked the dreary courtyard where the
prisoners were exercising. After a moment, when he
seemed to mechanically count the blades of grass between
the flagstones, he turned. The judge was
watching him, his hat on like a snuffer, as usual, and
his hands in pockets.</p>

<p>“Judge Hollis,” said Caleb quietly, “if I told you
where I was, another witness would have to be called,
and neither you nor I would wish to call that witness.”</p>

<p>The judge looked at him steadily; Caleb returned
the look as steadily, and there was a heavy silence.</p>

<p>“By the Lord Harry!” said the judge at last, “I
believe you’d let ’em hang you rather than give in a
hair’s breadth.”</p>

<p>Then Caleb smiled his rare sweet smile.</p>

<p>The second long week of the trial wore to its close,
and the web of circumstantial evidence was clinging
fast about the prisoner. Witnesses had testified to
his character and against it. The name of Jean Bartlett<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
ran around the court, and some men testified to
a belief that Caleb was the father of the child he had
befriended. Judge Hollis did not attempt to have
the testimony ruled out; he let it go in, sitting back
with folded arms and a grim smile. He cross-examined
Jacob Eaton twice, but made nothing of it.
Jacob was an excellent witness, and he showed no
passion, even when witnesses described the duel and
his conduct to show his motive in attacking Trench.</p>

<p>Sunday night Judge Hollis received a telephone
message from Colonel Royall, and, after his early
supper, the judge ordered around his rockaway and
drove over, with Lysander beside him to hold the
reins. He found Mrs. Eaton in the drawing-room with
Diana, and was coldly received by Jacob’s mother;
she resented any attempt to line up forces against her
son, and she regarded the defender of Caleb Trench as
an enemy to society. The judge bowed before her
grimly.</p>

<p>“I thought you were in the city, madam,” he
remarked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eaton threw up her hands. “With that mob
loose, and the soldiers? My dear Judge! I wouldn’t
stay for a million, and I’m a poor woman. Good
gracious, think of it! It’s just as I’ve always said,—you
go on letting in the shiploads of anarchists and
we’ll all be murdered in our beds.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said the judge grimly, “the only thing
I ever let in is the cat. Sarah and the niggers look
after the front door.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>Mrs. Eaton raised her eyebrows. “I can’t understand
you,” she said, with distant politeness; “I
refer to immigration.”</p>

<p>“And I refer to immoderation, madam,” snapped
the judge.</p>

<p>Diana intervened. “Pa wants you,” she said
sweetly, and went with him across the hall to the
library. At the door she paused. “Judge Hollis,”
she said, “does the trial hinge on the question of the
time in the basement—before—before Mr. Trench
went up-stairs?”</p>

<p>The judge scowled. “It does,” said he flatly, “and
Caleb’s a fool.”</p>

<p>Diana smiled faintly; she looked unusually lovely
and very grave. “Judge,” she said, “no matter what
pa says, I’ll do it all; he’s demurred,” and with this
enigmatical sentence she thrust the judge inside the
door and closed it.</p>

<p>Monday the court met at noon and the throng was
greater than ever. Report had it that the case was
going to the jury, and men had slept on benches in
the square. The morning papers reprinted Caleb’s
famous speech at Cresset’s and the account of the
stand he had made in the face of the would-be lynching
party. Fed with this fuel, party feeling ran high;
besides, the Yarnall faction was deeply stirred. It
seemed as if this change in events had swept away
the chance of punishment for Jacob Eaton, who was
figuring largely and conspicuously in this trial and
who had caught the public eye. Moreover, he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
been industrious in circulating the scandalous tale of
Jean Bartlett. The court-room buzzed. Three times
Judge Ladd rapped for order and finally threatened
to clear the court-room. This was the day that the
crowd in the windows shut off all view for those in
the tree of heaven. It was a hot autumn day and the
air was heavy. Stout men like Judge Hollis looked
purple, and even Caleb flushed under the strain.</p>

<p>Colonel Coad cross-examined two witnesses in a
lengthy fashion that threatened to exhaust even the
patience of the court, and Judge Hollis was on his
feet every few minutes with objections. The judge
was out of temper, nervous and snappy, yet triumph
glowed in his eyes, for he scented battle and victory
at last.</p>

<p>The dreary day wore to an uneventful end, and
there was almost a sob of disappointment in the
packed and sweltering mass of humanity. One
woman fainted and the bailiffs had to bring ice-water.
Outside, the rifles rattled as the guards changed.</p>

<p>At five o’clock, just before the belated adjournment
hour, Judge Hollis rose and asked the clerk to
call a new witness for the defense. There was a languid
stir of interest, the judge looked irate, the jurors
shifted wearily in their chairs. The clerk called the
witness.</p>

<p>“Diana Royall.”</p>

<p>The sensation was immense; the court-room
hummed, the weariest juror turned and looked down
the crowded room. Very slowly a way was made to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
the witness-stand, and a tall slight figure in white,
with a broad straw hat and a light veil, came quietly
forward.</p>

<p>Caleb Trench turned deadly white.</p>

<p>In a stillness so intense that every man seemed to
hear only his own heart beat, the clerk administered
the oath and the new witness went on the stand.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JUDGE HOLLIS, standing before the witness-stand,
looked at Diana with fatherly eyes; his
manner lost its brusqueness and became that
of the old-fashioned gentleman of gallantry. Diana
herself looked across the court-room with a composure
and dignity of pose that became her. Every eye was
riveted upon her. For days the papers had reeked
with the story of Jean Bartlett and her child, yet
here—on the stand for the prisoner—was one of the
first young ladies in the State.</p>

<p>Judge Hollis had been taking notes, and he closed
his notebook on his finger and took off his gold-rimmed
spectacles.</p>

<p>“Where were you on the afternoon of Tuesday,
August eighteenth, about one o’clock, Miss Diana?”</p>

<p>Diana answered at once, and in a clear low voice.
“In this building, Judge, in a small room on the lower
floor.”</p>

<p>“A small room on the lower floor? Let us see, Miss
Diana,”—the judge tapped his book with his spectacles,—“the
room to the right, was it, at the end
of the west corridor?”</p>

<p>Diana explained the position of the room and the
vicinity of the staircase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“Ah,” said the old lawyer, with the air of having
made a discovery, “to be sure; it’s the room we call
‘the cage’—on the basement floor. Rather a dreary
place to wait, Miss Diana: how long were you there?”</p>

<p>“I am not sure,” she replied, coloring suddenly,
“but certainly an hour. It was a little after twelve
when we reached the building, and I heard the clock
strike one just before the shots were fired.”</p>

<p>“Ah! You heard the shots?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“How many did you hear, Miss Diana?” the judge
asked in his easiest, most conversational tone.</p>

<p>“Two, Judge, two reports in quick succession.”</p>

<p>“And you heard only two?” his tone was sharp,
incisive; it cut like a knife.</p>

<p>Diana threw him a startled glance, but she was
still composed, though the breathless silence in the
room was deeply affecting.</p>

<p>“I heard but two,” she said firmly.</p>

<p>“How soon after one o’clock?” he demanded, his
bony forefinger following her testimony, as it seemed,
across the cover of the book he held.</p>

<p>“The clock in the hall had just struck.” Diana
was holding every instinct, every thought, in hand.
Her eyes never left his rugged face, yet, all the while,
she was conscious of the court-room, growing dim in
the early twilight, of the rows of upturned eager
faces, but more conscious still of the pale face of
Caleb Trench.</p>

<p>Judge Hollis made some notes, then he looked up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
suddenly. “Miss Royall,” he said formally, “do you
know the prisoner at the bar?”</p>

<p>Diana drew a deep breath; she was aware of a
hundred pairs of curious eyes. The awful silence of
the room seemed to leap upon her and bear her down.
She turned her head with an effort and met Caleb’s
eyes. For a single second they looked at each other,
with the shock of mutual feeling, then she answered,
and her low voice reached the farthest corner of the
crowded room.</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>Judge Hollis waited an instant; he let every word
she said have its full effect and weight. “Did you
see him upon the morning of the assassination?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“In the basement of the court-house?”</p>

<p>“In the room which you call the cage, Judge
Hollis,” she replied quietly, though she colored again;
“I saw him there twice.”</p>

<p>“At what time?” the old man’s harsh voice rang,
like the blow of a sledge-hammer.</p>

<p>“He was with me in that room when the clock
struck one, and we both heard the shots fired.” Diana
spoke gently, but her voice thrilled; she knew that,
in the face of the scurrilous attacks upon Caleb
Trench, her position was at once courageous and
perilous.</p>

<p>“He was in the room in the basement with you
then, when Yarnall was shot,” said Judge Hollis, his
eyes kindling with triumph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>“He was.”</p>

<p>She had scarcely uttered the words, and Caleb
Trench’s white face had flushed deeply, when some one
cheered. In an instant there was a wave of applause.
It swept through the room, it reached the corridors
and descended the stairs; the sentries heard it in the
quadrangle. Men stood up on the rear benches and
shouted. Then Judge Ladd enforced silence; he
even threatened to clear the court by force and lock
the doors, and like a wave of the sea, the wild enthusiasm
receded, only to gain force and roll back at the
first opportunity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Colonel Royall sat behind the witness-stand,
leaning on his cane, his head bowed and his
fine aristocratic face as bloodless as a piece of paper.
There were many who pointed at him and whispered,
and the whisper traveled. “Was he thinking of his
girl’s mother?” That foul hag, the world, has a
heart that treasures scandal, and the lips of
malice!</p>

<p>The court-room seethed with excitement, but
silence reigned again; the lights were flaring now on
the judge’s desk and on the reporters’ table; the busy
scratch of the stenographers’ pens was audible.
Diana was still on the stand, and she explained how
Caleb Trench left her to ascertain the results of the
shots, and how he returned and got her father and
herself into their carriage. Her testimony was simple
and direct, and, though she was briefly cross-examined
by Colonel Coad, the prosecuting attorney, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
sustained her position and suffered nothing at the
hands of that pompous but courteous gentleman.</p>

<p>When Diana rose from the witness-stand and
walked back to her seat between her father and Miss
Sarah Hollis, there was another ripple of the wave of
applause, but it was quickly suppressed. She leaned
back in her chair and clasped her hands tightly in her
lap, struggling with herself, for she was conscious of
a new tumult of feeling that submerged even thought
itself; and it seemed to her that her heart beat, not
only in her bosom, but in every quivering limb. Was
it possible, she asked herself, that the tumult in the
court-room had frightened her? Or the fact that on
her word alone hung a man’s life? No, no, not altogether;
in that moment, when their eyes met, she
had seen again the lonely trail and heard the dull
passion in the man’s voice when he told her that he
loved her; and suddenly, in one of those supreme
moments of self-revelation, she knew that nothing
mattered to her, neither his humble struggle, his
poverty, the accusation against him, not even Jean
Bartlett’s story, nothing—nothing counted but that
one primitive, undeniable fact of his love for her.
Before it she felt suddenly defenseless, yet another
self was awakening to vigilance in her heart and
summoning her back to the battle of resistance. She
had testified for him, and every face in the court-room
turned toward her, strained to watch her, told
her how great had been the weight of her testimony.
She had deceived herself with the thought that only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
her duty brought her, her honor, her determination
that justice should be done. Yet she knew now that
it was not that, but something mightier, deeper, more
unconquerable,—something that, to her shame, refused
even to consider the charges against him, and,
instead, drew her to him with a force so irresistible
that she trembled. She fought it back and struggled,
resisted and tried to fix her attention on the proceedings
of the court. But what was there in the man?
What power that had won its way even with men and
made him in so short a time a leader, and now—was
it casting its spell over her?</p>

<p>Then she heard her father testifying briefly to the
time that he left her, to his own visit to Judge Ladd’s
room, the announcement of the shooting, and his
return to Diana. It was in the order of sustaining
her testimony, but it was unnecessary, for she had
already established an <i>alibi</i> for Trench.</p>

<p>Then followed a tilt between counsel on the admission
of testimony from Dr. Cheyney as to the character
of the defendant. Colonel Coad resisted, fighting
point by point. Judge Hollis was determined and
vindictive; he even lost his temper and quarreled
with the Commonwealth attorney, and would, doubtless,
have become profane if the court had not intervened
and sustained him. In that moment the old
lawyer triumphed openly, his eyes flashing, his face
nearly purple with excitement. But the tilt was not
over when the doctor was put on the stand. It became
evident, in a moment, that Judge Hollis was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
bent on the story of Jean Bartlett, and Colonel Coad
got to his feet and objected. Again silence reigned
in the court-room, and they heard the tree of heaven
creak under its weight of human fruit. Inch by inch
Colonel Coad fought and Judge Hollis won. Testimony
had been admitted to damage the character
of the prisoner; he was offering this in sur-rebuttal.
It was half-past six when Colonel Coad gave up and
the old judge put on his spectacles and stared into
the spectacled eyes of the old doctor. The two eager,
lined old faces were as wonderful in their shrewd
watchfulness as two faces from the brush of Rembrandt.
The dingy, green-shaded lights flickered on
them, and the suppressed excitement of the room
thrilled about them, until the very atmosphere
seemed charged.</p>

<p>“You have heard the prisoner charged with the
ruin of Jean Bartlett, Dr. Cheyney?” asked the judge.</p>

<p>“I have, sir.”</p>

<p>“You knew Jean Bartlett before and after the
birth of her child; what was her mental condition at
those times?”</p>

<p>“Before the birth of her child she was sane; afterwards
she was ill a long time and never fully recovered
from the fever and delirium.”</p>

<p>“Did she make any statement to you before the
birth of the child?”</p>

<p>Colonel Coad objected; Judge Hollis said that he
intended to show that the prisoner was not the father
of the child. Objection not sustained. The judge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
looked sideways at Colonel Coad and coughed; the
colonel sat down. The judge repeated his question.</p>

<p>“She did,” said Dr. Cheyney slowly, leaning a little
forward and looking intently at the old lawyer. A
breathless pause ensued.</p>

<p>“Please state to the court the condition and nature
of that statement.” Judge Hollis’ tone was dry, rasping,
unemotional.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney took off his spectacles, wiped them
and put them in his pocket. “She was of sound mind
and she stated her case to me, and I made her repeat
it and write it down, because”—the old doctor’s
face twisted a little into a whimsical grimace,—“I
thought likely the child might be handed around
considerable.”</p>

<p>A titter ran through the room. Judge Ladd rapped
for order. Dr. Cheyney unfolded a slip of paper and
smoothed it out.</p>

<p>“If it please the court,” he said quietly, “I have
been very reluctant to produce this evidence.”</p>

<p>Colonel Coad rose. “Does it incriminate any person,
or persons, not on trial before this court?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“It does.”</p>

<p>“Then, your Honor, I object!” shouted the indignant
Coad.</p>

<p>Judge Hollis turned to speak.</p>

<p>“The objection is sustained,” said the court.</p>

<p>The old lawyer for the defense turned purple again,
and flashed a furious glance at Dr. Cheyney. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
doctor smiled, his face puckering. The tense excitement
and curiosity in the room found utterance in
a sigh of disappointment. Judge Hollis slammed
his papers on his desk and turned the witness over to
the prosecution. Colonel Coad did not press the examination,
and the old doctor went calmly back to
his seat with his secret untold.</p>

<p>Hollis turned to the court. “Your Honor, I waive
the right to sum up, and rest the case for the
defense.”</p>

<p>An hour later Colonel Coad had closed for the prosecution
and Judge Ladd charged the jury.</p>

<p>There had been no recess, and the crowded room
was packed to suffocation. Everywhere were faces,
white, haggard, intent with excitement, and the
labored breathing of men who hung upon a word. A
thunderstorm was coming on, and now and then a
vivid flash flooded the room with light. At half-past
eight Judge Ladd gave the case to the jury. The
foreman rose and stated that the jury had reached a
verdict without leaving the box.</p>

<p>There was an intense moment, and then Judge Ladd
spoke slowly.</p>

<p>“Have you agreed upon a verdict?”</p>

<p>“We have, your Honor.”</p>

<p>“Is the prisoner at the bar guilty, or not guilty, as
charged in the indictment?”</p>

<p>“Not guilty.”</p>

<p>The wave of passion and excitement broke, the
court-room rose as one man; the shout was heard ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
squares away, and the echo reached the farthest
corner of the city. The bailiffs fought and struggled
to keep order, for men would have carried the prisoner
on their shoulders. He was the only one unmoved.
He stood like a rock amid the surging crowd, and it
seemed to Diana that he towered, with a certain
simplicity and strength that made him seem at once
apart from other men and above them. In her heart
she wondered at her own temerity, when she had
treated him with discourtesy. Here was a primitive
man, and the primitive strength, the righteous force
in him, held other men, as that strange gift of magnetism
that wields and binds and moves millions till
they seem but one.</p>

<p>She turned away, holding tightly to her father’s
arm, eager to escape, and begrudging the slow and
tortuous passage to the door. Behind her and before
her, on every hand, from lip to lip, ran the prisoner’s
name.</p>

<p>The colonel almost lifted Diana from the crowd
into the carriage. Then he took his seat beside her
and closed the door; slowly the horses made their
way through the throng in the quadrangle. It was
raining hard, and the wind blew the moisture across
their heated faces.</p>

<p>“By gum!” said Colonel Royall, “they’ll make
him governor! But Jacob Eaton—Jacob Eaton!”</p>

<p>The old man was bewildered; he passed his hand
over his face. Diana said nothing; the night blurred
itself into the rain.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was long past midnight when Mrs. Eaton went
down-stairs for the fourth time to see if her son
had returned home.</p>

<p>She was alone with the servants in the old Eaton
house, which was three miles from Broad Acres, and
she had not ventured out in the storm, which had been
raging since early evening. The wind shook the old
house at intervals with the moan of autumn in the
gale, yet the roll of thunder recalled midsummer.
Once she had looked out and, in a blinding flash, saw
the old cottonwoods in front of the house stripped
naked by the wind. There was a weird aspect to the
world in that one fierce moment of illumination, and
the tumult of sounds without, the creaking of the old
house within, and the interminable ticking of the
clocks recalled to her shrinking mind a memory of
that other night, long ago, when she had been summoned
home from Lexington, to find her husband’s
dead body in the long west room, and hear the whisperings
of the terrified servants on the stairs. She knew
that even now the negroes were locked in the wing, for
they believed that on such nights Eaton walked,
demanding the blood of the Yarnalls, and since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
Yarnall’s death, violent as his own, they had shrieked
at shadows.</p>

<p>Though she realized the folly of their superstitions,
poor Jinny Eaton, alone and vaguely terrified,
shivered too. Once she caught herself looking
over her shoulder, and at last she cried hysterically.
The wind, sweeping a long branch against the window,
rattled the pane, and she started up, white with fright.
In a sudden panic she rang for her maid, but no one
answered, though she heard the blurred sound far in
the distance; a glance at the clock told her it was
nearly two. There was no light except in the hall
and the library, where she herself had turned the
electric switch, and she walked through all the other
dim rooms, starting at a shadow, and looking over her
shoulder when the floors creaked behind her. The
house was much more richly furnished than Broad
Acres, and everywhere she was surrounded with the
luxuries that she loved. But alone there, in those
desolate hours before the dawn, poor Jinny found no
comfort in the things that had always seemed so
comforting. In a vague way at first, and constantly
resisting even her own convictions, she had begun to
feel a doubt of Jacob,—Jacob, who had been almost
omnipotent to her, who had represented all her hopes
and aspirations for years, and was, in her own eyes,
the achievement of her life. To have her faith in him
shaken was more bitter than death. And where was
he? A premonition of evil oppressed her, as she wandered
from place to place in restless unhappiness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
Earlier in the night she had tried in vain to reach him
over the telephone: now her only resource was to
wait. She went from window to window, peeping
out, her face drawn and haggard, and all the well-preserved
traces of her former beauty lost in her
pathetic dishevelment. She watched the morning
dawn over the long fields that smoked with moisture,
and she saw the broken limbs of the trees and the
dead leaves that scurried before the wind, like the
shriveled ghosts of summer. Then, just as she had
given up the vigil, and sank in a disconsolate heap in
the nearest chair, she heard his latch-key in the door,
and running into the hall fell on his neck in a fit of
hysterical weeping.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jacob,” she sobbed, “where have you been?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly!” he said crossly, and loosened her
arms from his neck. “I’m dead beat; where’s
Davidson? I want something.”</p>

<p>“The servants are not up yet,” his mother faltered.
“I’ll get you some whiskey and soda, dear, and I’ll
ring up Davidson. I’ve been up all night.”</p>

<p>Jacob flung himself into a chair and sat there waiting
for her to bring the liquor and wait on him, as
she had waited on him all his life. But, if she thought
of this at all, it was only with an alarmed perception
of the haggard moodiness of his expression. She saw
that he had been drinking heavily already, but she
dared not deny him more, and, in a way, she had
faith in his own judgment in the matter. She had
never known him to drink more than he was able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
bear, and she did not know that Will Broughton said
that Trench owed his life to Eaton’s tippling, and
steadier nerves and a firmer hand would have dealt
certain death. She came back at last, after a lengthy
excursion to the pantry, and brought him some refreshments,
arranged hastily on a little tray by hands
so unaccustomed to any sick-room service that they
were almost awkward. She put the things down beside
him on the table and fluttered about, eager to
help him and almost afraid of him, as she was in his
ungracious moods. But her desire for news, the certainty
that he could settle all her doubts, lent a
pleasurable thrill of excitement to her trepidation.
Her news from the city had been vague, and the announcement
of Caleb’s acquittal had only filtered to
her over a belated telephone to the housekeeper, but
here was the fountainhead of all her information.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jacob drank the liquor, but scarcely
tasted the food, and his lowering expression disfigured
his usually smooth good looks. He leaned back
in his chair, staring absently at the bottle, and saying
nothing, though he slowly closed and unclosed his
hands, a trick of his when angry or deeply distraught.
His mother, seeing the gesture, experienced another
throb of dismay; something had happened, something
which struck at the root of things, but what? She
fluttered to the window and opening the shutter let
in the pale gray light of morning, and as she did it
she heard the servants stirring in the wing. At last
she could endure suspense no longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>“For heaven’s sake, Jacob!” she cried, “what is
the matter?”</p>

<p>He gave her a sidelong look from under heavy lids
and seemed to restrain an impulse to speak out. “I
suppose you know that rascal is acquitted?” he said
curtly.</p>

<p>“I could scarcely believe it!” she replied, dropping
into the chair opposite and pushing back her long full
sleeves and loosening the ribbons at her throat, as if
she suddenly felt the heat. “It seems impossible—after
your evidence, too, and Governor Aylett’s!
That jury must have been full of anarchists.”</p>

<p>“Full of asses!” snapped Jacob. “I fancy that
you don’t know that Diana Royall got up on the
witness-stand and made a public exhibition of herself
to clear him?”</p>

<p>“Diana?” Mrs. Eaton could not believe her ears.</p>

<p>“Yes, Diana,” mocked her son, “our Diana. She
went on the stand and created a sensation, took the
court by storm and the city. Good Lord! Her
name’s in every club in the place.”</p>

<p>“I—I can’t believe it!” gasped his mother: “it’s
incredible—Diana Royall?”</p>

<p>“Incredible?” He rose, his face was white with
fury. “Is it incredible? Do you remember her
mother?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Eaton collapsed. “Jacob!” she breathed,
“don’t! It makes me shiver to think you might have
married her.”</p>

<p>“By God, I would to-day!” he cried, unable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
restrain himself, “if only to break her spirit, to make
her pay for this!”</p>

<p>“I can’t see what she knew,” Mrs. Eaton protested,
“she—a young girl—and all this awful scandal
about Jean Bartlett in the papers. In my day, a
young girl would have been ashamed to show her face
in the court.”</p>

<p>“Well, she wasn’t,” said Jacob dryly; “she appeared
and told the court that at the hour of the
shooting she was alone with Caleb Trench in the
prisoners’ cage!”</p>

<p>“Merciful heavens!” ejaculated Mrs. Eaton faintly,
“was David crazy to let her do it?”</p>

<p>“He’s an old fool!” said Jacob fiercely, “a damned
old fool!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Eaton clasped her hands. “I’m only too
thankful, Jacob, that you never married her!” she
said devoutly.</p>

<p>“She’s refused me twice,” said Jacob grimly.</p>

<p>His mother uttered an inarticulate sound. And at
that instant Davidson, an old gray-headed negro,
appeared and Jacob called him. “Tell James to
pack my suit-case,” he said sharply. “I’m going
to Lexington this morning on the eight-forty.”</p>

<p>“Doctor Cheyney’s at the doah, suh,” said Davidson,
“and would like ter see yo’.”</p>

<p>“What does that old fool want, I wonder?” Jacob
remarked, as he rose to follow the negro into the
hall.</p>

<p>“What are you going so soon for, Jacob?” his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
mother asked tremulously, “and can you—the
bail—”</p>

<p>“I’ve arranged that,” said Jacob shortly, and flung
himself out of the room.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney was looking out from under the cover
of his buggy, and old Henk was breathing as if they
had ascended the hill at an unusual gait.</p>

<p>“Morning, Jacob,” said the doctor pleasantly, “I
stopped by to leave that book for your mother; Mrs.
Broughton asked me to bring it when I passed yesterday
and I clean forgot it.”</p>

<p>Jacob took the volume gingerly and looked politely
bored. What in the world did the old fool mean by
bringing books before seven o’clock in the morning?</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney gathered up the reins: conversation
seemed improbable, but he noticed that Davidson
had gone back into the house. They were quite
alone under the leaden sky, and the fresh wind blew
moist across their faces.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said the old man carelessly, “Judge
Hollis has been with Juniper all night and at six this
morning I heard he had a confession.”</p>

<p>Jacob looked up into the doctor’s eyes, his own
narrowing. “Ah,” he said, “I presume Judge Hollis
makes out that Juniper did the shooting?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” said Dr. Cheyney, slapping the
reins on Henk’s broad back, “heard there would be
an arrest to-day,” and he drove slowly off, the old
wheels sinking in first one rut and then another, and
jolting the carriage from side to side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>Jacob Eaton stood looking after it a minute, then
he turned and went into the house. It was now
seven o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>That evening, at the corresponding hour, Colonel
Royall and Diana were dining alone at Broad Acres.
The fact that Diana had been drawn into an undesirable
publicity through her unexpected connection
with the celebrated case troubled Colonel Royall profoundly.
He was an old-fashioned Southern gentleman,
and believed devoutly in sheltering and
treasuring his beautiful daughter; every instinct had
been jarred upon by the mere fact of her appearance
on the witness-stand, and the circumstances, too,
which made it practically his own fault. He blamed
himself for his carelessness in ignorantly leaving her in
a room used by the prisoners and, in fact, for taking
her there at all. Yet he fully sympathized with her
in her courage. Behind it all, however, was a memory
which stung, and the knowledge that an old scandal
is never really too dead to rise, like a phœnix, from
its ashes.</p>

<p>All through the latter part of the summer the
colonel had been unwell, and lately Diana had watched
him with deep concern. Dr. Cheyney pooh-poohed
her solicitude, said the colonel was as sound as a boy
of ten, and only advised a cheerful atmosphere. But
Diana, sitting opposite to him that day at dinner,
saw how white and drawn his face was, how pinched
his lips, how absent his gentle blue eyes. She felt a
sudden overwhelming dread and found it difficult to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
talk and laugh lightly, even when he responded with
an eagerness that was an almost pathetic attempt at
his natural manner.</p>

<p>They were just leaving the dining-room when Judge
Hollis was announced, and Diana was almost glad,
even of this interruption, though she was conscious of
a sharp dread that they were to hear more of the trial.
A glance at the judge’s face as he stalked into the
room confirmed this impression; he was no longer
wholly triumphant, his rugged jaw was locked, and
his shaggy brows hung low over his keen eyes. He
walked into the center of the room as usual and
banged his hat down on the table.</p>

<p>“David,” he said abruptly, “how deep are you in
with Jacob Eaton?”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall leaned forward in his chair, his
hands clasping the arms. “Pretty well in,” he said
simply, “unless he’s sold out my shares for me. I
asked it, but he didn’t do it last week.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lordy!” said the judge.</p>

<p>Diana went around the table and put her hand on
her father’s shoulder; her young figure, drawn to its
full height, seemed to stand between him and impending
misfortune.</p>

<p>“Juniper confessed this morning,” said Judge Hollis
harshly, forcing himself to his unpleasant task. “He
was hired by Jacob Eaton to stand in the window of
the court-room while Jacob fired from behind him
and killed Yarnall.”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall rose and stood, white as ashes.
“My God!” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>Diana flung one arm around him. Judge Hollis
stood looking at them a moment, then he cleared his
throat, choked and went on.</p>

<p>“Caleb Trench to-day gave me the proofs that
Aaron Todd and others have collected in regard to
the Eaton Investment Company. The shares are not
worth the paper they’re written on, the company is
a name, a bubble, a conspiracy. Not one cent will
ever be recovered by the stockholders. Before nine
o’clock this morning Jacob Eaton jumped his bail and
ran. He can’t be found—he—”</p>

<p>Diana suddenly stretched out a white arm before
her father, as if she warded off a blow.</p>

<p>“Not another word, Judge,” she said sternly, “not
a word—on your life!”</p>

<p>Judge Hollis uttered an exclamation and went over
to the colonel’s side. “Royall,” he said, “I’m a
brute—but it’s God’s truth.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Colonel Royall, “and Jacob is of
my blood—I feel the disgrace. Hollis, I feel the
disgrace!” and he sat down and covered his face with
his hands.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TWO mornings later Dr. Cheyney finished his
breakfast in abstracted silence; not even
Miss Lucinda’s best rice griddle-cakes calling
forth a word of approval. He had been talking over
the telephone with Diana Royall. He finished his
perfunctory examination of the daily paper, which
was full of the flight of Jacob Eaton, the collapse of
the Eaton Investment Company, the ruin of many
prominent citizens, and the illness of Mrs. Eaton, who
had been sent at once to a private sanitarium in the
city.</p>

<p>The absorbing topic of Eaton had almost swallowed
up the hitherto absorbing topic of Caleb Trench,
though Caleb once more loomed up, directing the
forces of the opposition.</p>

<p>The doctor folded the paper viciously and put it in
his pocket, then he went out and climbed into his old
buggy; he remembered quite distinctly that other
morning when he had climbed into it at six o’clock
to drive past the Eatons at a convenient hour. It
might be said that the old man was so hardened in
kindly iniquity that his conscience never suffered a
single twinge. He and old Henk traveled more slowly
up the hill, however, than on that previous occasion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
As he approached Broad Acres he was struck with the
dreary aspect of the autumn, and noticed that even
the house itself looked less cheerful. He had seen
Colonel Royall’s name on every quotation of losses
in the Eaton Company, and he drew his own
conclusions.</p>

<p>At the door Diana met him. She was very pale.</p>

<p>“Dear Dr. Cheyney,” she said, holding out both
hands, “it’s a relief to see you! I couldn’t tell you
over the ’phone—but—” She stopped, her lips
trembled.</p>

<p>“What is it, Diana?” the old man asked gently.</p>

<p>“You know the Shut Room?” She looked up
imploringly.</p>

<p>The silence of the house behind her seemed impenetrable;
the long hall was vacant.</p>

<p>“I know,” said the doctor, and Diana understood
that he knew even more than she did.</p>

<p>“He’s been sitting there alone; he will not let me
stay with him,” she explained.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney stood a moment in some doubt, his
hand at his chin in a familiar attitude of thought.
His gospel refused to intrude into the confidence of
any one, but there were cases where it might be an
absolute necessity to interfere; the question which
confronted him was whether or not this was one of
these rare instances.</p>

<p>“How long has it been?” he asked finally.</p>

<p>“Two whole days,” replied Diana, “and he has
scarcely eaten a mouthful. This morning he took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
only one cup of coffee; he looks like death. And you
know how it is,—that room always affects him so, he
never seems himself after he has been there. Sometimes,”
she added passionately, “sometimes—I wish
I could wall it up!”</p>

<p>“I wish you could!” said Dr. Cheyney devoutly.</p>

<p>“He sits there and looks out of the window: and
twice he has forbidden me to come there,” Diana
went on. “What can I do? It—it breaks my heart
to see him so, and I’m sure my mother would not wish
it, but he will not listen to that.”</p>

<p>The old doctor’s lips came together in a sharp line:
without another word he turned and went up the
stairs, reluctance in his step. At the landing was a
stained glass window, the work of a famous European
artist, and the doctor glanced at it with a certain
weariness: personally he preferred plate glass and a
long glimpse of level fields. He had reached the head
of the second broad flight now, and the second door
to the left of the wide hall was ajar, the door which
was usually shut and locked. Where the doctor stood
he could see across the room, for one of the window
shutters was open, and it looked still as it had looked
twenty-three years before, when Diana was born.
There were the same soft and harmonious coloring,
the same rich old furniture, the deep-hued Turkey
rug on the polished floor, the spotless ruffled curtains.
It was unchanged. Life may change a thousand
times while these inanimate things remain to mock
us with their endurance. The doctor moved resolutely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
forward and pushed open the door. Colonel
Royall was sitting erect in a high-backed chair in
the center of the room, his hands clasping the arms,
his head bowed, and his kindly blue eyes staring
straight before him. He was singularly pale and
seemed to have aged twenty years. Dr. Cheyney
walked slowly across the room and laid his hand on
his old friend’s shoulder,—they had been boys
together.</p>

<p>“Is it as bad as that, Davy?” he asked.</p>

<p>Colonel Royall roused himself with an apparent
effort, and looked up with an expression in which
patient endurance and great grief were strongly
mingled. There was a touch, too, of dignity and reluctance
in his manner, yet if he resented the doctor’s
intrusion he was too courteous to show it. “I’m
pretty hard hit, William,” he said simply, “pretty
hard hit all around; there’s not much more to be
said—that hasn’t been said already on the street
corners and in the market-place.”</p>

<p>His wounded pride showed through his manner
without destroying his delicate restraint.</p>

<p>The doctor drew a chair beside him and sat down
unasked. His sympathy was a beautiful thing and
needed no voicing; it reached out imperceptible
feelers and made him intuitively aware of the raw
cut where not even tenderness may lay a finger.</p>

<p>“It’s not all gone, David?” he inquired.</p>

<p>Colonel Royall ran his fingers through his thick
white hair. “Pretty much all, William,” he said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
mechanically; “the place here is free, unmortgaged,
I mean, and I reckon I can hold the property in Virginia,
but the rest—” He raised his hands with a
significant and pathetic gesture; he had fine old
hands, and they had saved and directed from his
youth up until now—to this end! To have trusted
too deeply to an unworthy relative. William Cheyney
leaned back in his chair; the awful actuality of the
calamity was borne in upon him, and he remembered,
even at that moment, his feeling of confidence in the
stability of Colonel Royall’s fortune, though, sometimes,
he had doubted the colonel’s money sense.
There was sometimes, too, a terrible synchronism
between ruin and mental collapse. He looked keenly
at the old man before him, who seemed suddenly
shrunken and gray, and he was troubled by the absent
expression of the mild blue eyes; it was almost
a look of vacancy. He laid his hand tenderly on the
other’s arm.</p>

<p>“Davy, man,” he said, “cheer up; there are worse
things than financial losses.”</p>

<p>The colonel recalled himself apparently from very
distant scenes and gazed at him reproachfully. “No
one can know that better than I,” he said, with a
touch of bitterness.</p>

<p>The doctor stretched out his hand with a bowed
head. “Forgive me, David,” he said simply.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to forgive,” replied Colonel
Royall. “I let you say things, William, that other
men could not say to me. But this is a bitter hour;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
my youth was not idle, I never knew an idle day, and
I laid up a fortune in place of my father’s competence;
I wanted to spend my old age in peace, and I trusted
my affairs to a rogue. By gum, I hate to call my
cousin’s son a rascal, but it seems he is! Not half the
burden, though, lies in my own loss; it’s the thought
of all these poor people he has ruined. Women and
girls and old men who had savings—all gone in the
Eaton Investment Company. What was it Caleb
Trench stated about that company? It seems as if
I couldn’t understand it all, I’m—I’m dizzy!”
The colonel touched his forehead apprehensively.</p>

<p>The doctor regarded him thoughtfully over his
spectacles, but he made no reservations. “Well,
there isn’t any investment company; that’s about
the size of it, David,” he said reluctantly. “People
bought their shares and got—waste paper. They
say Jacob used lots of the money campaigning; it
isn’t charged that he wanted it for himself.”</p>

<p>“I’ve always held that blood was thicker than
water,” said Colonel Royall, “and Jacob is a thief—a
thief, sir!” he added, putting aside an interruption
from the doctor with a wide sweep of the hand. “He’s
robbed hundreds in this State because his name, his
family, stood for honesty, business reputation, honor—and
once I thought him fit to be my confidant!”</p>

<p>“We’re all deceived sometimes, David,” said the
doctor soothingly, watching him with his keen skillful
look, “we’re not omniscient; if we were, there’d be
a lot more folks in jail, I reckon. I wouldn’t take it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
to heart; Jacob was on his own responsibility; they
can’t blame you.”</p>

<p>“They ought to,” declared the colonel passionately.
“I’m an old man, I’m his relative; it was my business
to know what he was doing. And there’s poor
Jinny! I wanted her to come here, so did Diana, and
you packed her off to a sanitarium.”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said Dr. Cheyney grimly; “there’s
no need of having three lunatics instead of one.
Jinny’s nerves were about wrecked, she needs quiet,
and she’ll come out well enough; it’s not Jinny I’m
worried about. You let Jacob go, don’t you shoulder
Jacob; no one thinks you’re to blame!”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall let his clenched hand fall on the arm
of his chair. “The disgrace of it!” he said, and his
lips trembled. “I’ve had my share of disgrace,
William!”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney rose abruptly and walked to the window.
Through the open shutter he could see, from
this side of the house, the distant river, and near at
hand was a tall jingo tree, yellow as gold with autumn.
The other trees stood half naked against the sky.
Below him a few white chickens strayed on the lawn
unrebuked.</p>

<p>“You see more of the river since the railroad cut
that last crossing,” Colonel Royall remarked irrelevantly,
“and have you noticed how late the jingo
stays in leaf? It was so the year that—” He
stopped.</p>

<p>The doctor turned and fixed an irate eye upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>Colonel Royall was leaning forward, his eyes fixed
absently on the window, yet he had felt instinctively
the doctor’s attitude. “It may be folly,” he pleaded,
as if in extenuation, “but I don’t want the place
changed; it was like this when she was happy here
and”—his head sank lower—“I’ve got to sell it!
I’ve got to sell it—oh, my God!”</p>

<p>The doctor went over and took hold of him.
“Davy!” he said fiercely, “Davy, you’ve got to get
out of here! I’m glad it’s to be sold; have done
with it! You’ve got to eat and drink and sleep or
you’ll—”</p>

<p>He stopped, his hands still on his old friend’s, for
Colonel Royall had slipped gently into unconsciousness,
and lay white and helpless in the high-backed
chair.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was late that night before Dr. Cheyney drove
away from Broad Acres. Colonel Royall had
rallied a little, and the doctor and the servants
had put him to bed, not in the Shut Room, but in his
own old four-poster that had belonged to his mother.</p>

<p>Before the doctor went away he had sent for a
trained nurse and received and answered telegrams
for Diana, who would not leave her father. At half-past
ten the old doctor drove up to his own door,
overtaxed and weary. As he climbed down from his
old buggy his quick eye detected a brighter light than
usual in his study window, and Miss Lucinda Colfax
met him at the door.</p>

<p>“There’s been a lady waiting to see you for two
hours,” she whispered, pointing mysteriously at the
study door.</p>

<p>The doctor sighed as he slipped off his overcoat. It
was some belated patient, of course, and a stranger,
or Miss Lucinda would have named her. He looked
pale and worn, and his white head was bowed a little
with care, and the thought of old David, whom he
loved, as he opened the study door and came into the
circle of light from the student’s lamp on the table.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
A fire burned on the hearth, and a woman sat in the
great old-fashioned winged chair before it. As he
entered she rose and stood facing him. There was a
certain grace and ease in the tall figure and the black
gown, but she wore a thick veil covering both her
large hat and her face and throat. She made a movement,
an involuntary one, it seemed, as the old man
came toward her, and she saw the pallor and age in
his face, a face which was full of a rare sweetness and
strength. But, whatever her first impulse was, the
sight of him seemed to arrest it, to turn it aside, and
she drew back, laying her hand on the high chair and
saying nothing.</p>

<p>“I am sorry that you had to wait so long, madam,”
Dr. Cheyney said, “but I was with a very sick man.
What can I do for you? Will you be seated?” he
added, drawing forward another chair.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she replied in a low voice, sinking
into the chair by which she stood. “I wanted to
speak to you—about—about—some old friends.”</p>

<p>“Ah?” The doctor looked curiously at the veil.
He could not distinguish a feature under it, but he
seemed to be aware of the feverish brightness of her
eyes.</p>

<p>“I—I used to know people here,” she began and
stopped, hesitating.</p>

<p>He did not offer to help her.</p>

<p>“I was born near here; I used to know you.”
She leaned forward, clasping her hands on her knee,
and he noticed that her fingers trembled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“I am an old man and forgetful,” he said pleasantly;
“you must jog my memory. Who are the
friends you wish to ask for?”</p>

<p>“Friends?” she repeated in a strange voice.</p>

<p>“You said friends,” he replied mildly.</p>

<p>She turned her face toward him, lifting her veil.
“Don’t you know me?” she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney, looking over the tops of his spectacles,
eyed her gravely. It was a handsome face, slightly
pale, with large eyes and full red lips, beautiful, no
doubt, in its first youth, but lined now and hardened,
with an indefinable expression which was elusive,
fluttering, passionate, and most of all unhappy. The
old man shook his head. She rose from her seat and
crossing the room quickly, laid her large white hand
on his arm. She was close to him now; he could see
her breathing stir the laces on her bosom, and was
sharply conscious of the agitation that possessed her
and seemed to thrill her very touch upon his sleeve.
She looked into his eyes, her own wild and sorrowful.</p>

<p>“Is it possible? Don’t you know me?”</p>

<p>He returned her gaze sorrowfully, his face changing
sharply. “Yes,” he said soberly, after a moment,
“I do now, Letty.”</p>

<p>“Letty!” She bit her lips, with a little hard sob,
and her fingers fell from his arm. “My God!” she
cried, “how it all comes back! No one has called me
that in twenty years.”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney made no responsive movement or gesture;
he stood looking at her quietly, curiously, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
little sadly. He noted the dignity of figure, and
certain fine lines of beauty that had rather matured
than diminished, yet the change in her was for the
worse in his eyes. Whatever there had been of passion
and vanity and waywardness in her face in her
youth had crystallized with maturity; there was a
palpable worldliness in her manner which sharpened
his conception of her as she must be now. The long
gap in the years since he had known her as she was,
until now, when she must be another person, was
opened suddenly by the realization of the change in
her, and it seemed to him that only a woman could
change so much. Deeply moved herself, she was only
half conscious of the criticism of his glance; she came
back across the room after a moment and stood beside
him, looking at the falling embers, the glow of
the fire acting weirdly in its illumination of her face.</p>

<p>“Tell me about him,” she said in a low voice; “I
know he has lost nearly everything.”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney’s lips tightened a little, and he
frowned. “Why do you want to know?” he asked
gravely.</p>

<p>She blushed deeply and painfully. “You mean I
have no right?”</p>

<p>He nodded, looking at the fire.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, I haven’t,” she admitted quickly,
pleadingly. “But there is Diana—has he made her
hate me?”</p>

<p>“She thinks you dead,” Dr. Cheyney replied
quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“Dead?” She shuddered, looking up with frightened
eyes. Then her face blazed angrily. “What
right had he to do it? What right—to make her
believe a falsehood?”</p>

<p>The old man’s eyes met hers gravely, rebukingly.
“Wasn’t it the best way, Letty?” he asked gently.</p>

<p>Her blush deepened again, her brow, her chin, even
her throat were crimson. She bit her quivering lip
until the blood came. “You are very cruel,” she said
bitterly, “you righteous people!”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney leaned heavily on the mantel, his eyes
on the fire. “Would you have had us tell a little innocent
child that, Letty? Tell her that her mother
had deserted her and brought shame upon her?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that she has never known?” she
cried, amazed.</p>

<p>“Never. David did not wish her to know, and we
respected his wish. She believes her mother died
when she was three years old; she even has a deep
and constant tenderness for the Shut Room.”</p>

<p>She looked at him bewildered. “I do not understand.”</p>

<p>“Your room,” he explained simply; “he closed
the door on it that day, and for twenty years it has
been unchanged. Yesterday I saw the very book you
laid face downwards on the table, the handkerchief
you dropped. He has mourned you as dead. In his
gentleness, his humility, his greatness of soul, he
chooses to believe you died that day. He loved you
before it, he has loved and mourned you ever since.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
No one has ever heard a reproach from his lips, no
one ever will. You broke his heart.”</p>

<p>She covered her face with her hands and burst into
tears.</p>

<p>The old man stood looking at her unmoved, though
the storm of her emotion shook her from head to foot.
Still weeping, she threw herself into the chair by the
fire and bowed her head on her arms.</p>

<p>“It is twenty years,” she said at last, “and I have
suffered—have you never forgiven me, William
Cheyney?”</p>

<p>The old man’s face saddened yet more deeply.
“There was nothing for me to forgive; we all had
his great example.”</p>

<p>She looked up with swimming eyes, her lips twitching
with pain. “It’s twenty years—he married me
after David got the divorce, you knew that?”</p>

<p>The doctor nodded.</p>

<p>“He’s dead. Oh, he knew I had suffered, he
wearied of me, and now he’s dead and I’m all alone.
Oh, don’t you understand?” she held out both hands
toward him, “don’t you know why I came?”</p>

<p>The old man shook his head sadly. “God knows,”
he said.</p>

<p>“I want Diana!” she cried, “I want my daughter—I
want her love!”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney looked at her thoughtfully. “She’s
twenty-three, Letty,” he said simply, “and she loves
her father.”</p>

<p>She winced, turning her eyes from his to the fire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
“I have seen her,” she said, in subdued tones, “once
or twice when she did not know it. She looks—don’t
you think she looks as I did?” she added
eagerly.</p>

<p>“No,” he said sternly, “no, she’s like David’s
mother.”</p>

<p>She flushed angrily. “Oh, never!” she exclaimed.
“She is like me—but you won’t admit it.”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney shook his head.</p>

<p>Disappointed, she dropped her chin into her hand
and looked again into the fire. “David has lost
everything,” she said after a moment. “I know, I
heard in New York.”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney, looking down at her, wondered what
her secret thought was, how far remorse had touched
her? “I’m afraid he’s badly hit,” he admitted
slowly.</p>

<p>She rose and went to him, her hands trembling.
“Help me,” she said with feverish eagerness, “help
me to get Diana. I want her to come to me; I can
take care of her. It would help him, too. Oh, don’t
you see I could do that much?”</p>

<p>The old doctor’s penetrating eyes met hers. “You
can take care of her,” he repeated; “you were not
wealthy, Letty; have you grown so?”</p>

<p>“You have always been hard in your judgment of
me,” she cried bitterly. “I am not a bad woman—I
know, oh, I know I sinned! I married David so
young; I found out my mistake, and when Fenwick
came—I loved him, I ran away from my husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
and my child, I was wicked—oh, I know it! But I
suffered. I am not poor. He left me well off, almost
rich. I have a right to it, he married me, I am his
widow.”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney said nothing; he moved away from
her a little and again leant his elbow on the
mantel.</p>

<p>“Will you help me, will you go to Diana?” she
pleaded, following him with sorrowful eyes.</p>

<p>He shook his head. “Never!”</p>

<p>She wrung her hands unconsciously. “You think
I have no right to Diana?”</p>

<p>“Have you?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p>She hung her head, and the intensity of her suffering
touched him without shaking his resolve.</p>

<p>“Have you any right to spend a dollar of that
money on her?” he added; “surely you know that
she could not receive it?”</p>

<p>There was a long silence. She turned, and hiding
her face against the high back of the chair, sobbed
convulsively. “You want to rob me of the last thing
I have in the world!” she said at last.</p>

<p>“You deserted her,” he replied more gently.</p>

<p>She raised her face, wet with her passionate tears,
and held out both hands to him. “Will you help me,
will you tell her I am not dead? I am her mother;
she has a right to know it.”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney still regarded her. “He is very ill,
Letty,” he said, “he may die; would you rob him of
his daughter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>“No, oh, no!” she cried impetuously, “but I—I
want her, too; I have wanted her for twenty years.
Oh, Dr. Cheyney, there is joy in heaven over one
sinner that repenteth!”</p>

<p>“Diana will not go with you,” he said quietly. “I
know it, and if she would, I would not tell her.”</p>

<p>“You refuse?” She leaned forward, still holding
the chair with one hand and the other pressed against
her heart.</p>

<p>“Absolutely.”</p>

<p>She shivered. “Cruel!” she whispered bitterly.</p>

<p>He turned to his medicine cabinet and began to
unlock the door. “Stay a moment,” he said kindly,
“you need something, you will be ill.”</p>

<p>But she fastened her wraps at her throat and let
her veil fall over her face again. “I am not ill,” she
said bitterly, “only heart-broken.”</p>

<p>He urged her to taste the cordial in his hand, but
she put it aside and went to the door. The old man
followed her.</p>

<p>“Letty,” he said, “David Royall is very ill; do not
lay another sin against him on your conscience.”</p>

<p>She had opened the door and, at his words, turned
and laid her cheek against the lintel with a hard dry
sob. “I will see Diana,” she said.</p>

<p>The doctor made no reply; his quick ear had
caught the sound of a step on the veranda, and almost
at the same moment Caleb Trench appeared in
the lighted space before the open door.</p>

<p>“What is it, Caleb?” the doctor asked quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>The young man glanced at the tall woman who
still leaned against the door. “I’ve just got back
from town,” he said, “and I wanted to ask you about
Colonel Royall. I hear that he is ill.”</p>

<p>The woman started and drew away, and Caleb
saw it.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney shook his head apprehensively.
“Very ill,” he said; “he was taken with a sinking
spell about noon. Come in, Caleb, and I’ll tell you
about it.”</p>

<p>Trench stood aside to let the veiled woman pass
out, and then he followed Dr. Cheyney into the study
with a face of some anxiety. He looked worn and old
for his years, but resolutely calm. “How do you
think he really is?” he asked.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney sank down into his easy-chair by
the fire. “I’m not sure that he’ll live,” he said
despondently.</p>

<p>Trench frowned, making an inarticulate sound.
The firelight flared on his face now, and its expression
was significant. Dr. Cheyney bent down and began
a desultory search for his carpet slippers; even in the
most interesting moments of life, physical discomforts
pinch the unwary, and the old man’s feet ached.
“He’s worn out, broken-hearted,” he said, referring
to his old friend and removing his boots absently.
“He’s taken this affair to heart, too.”</p>

<p>“Jacob Eaton?”</p>

<p>The doctor nodded. “Smooth young scamp,” he
said bitterly, “I always wanted to deal out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
husks to him, but I reckon he’ll get ’em in the Lord’s
good time. It’s pretty bad, I suppose, Caleb.”</p>

<p>“Worse than we thought,” replied Caleb. “The
Harrisons’ bank closed its doors to-night; he’s
wrecked it and there’s a terrible panic in the city.
I wonder if he took much with him?”</p>

<p>“All he could get, I reckon,” mused the doctor, his
mind dwelling not on Jacob but on Letty, and the
climax which he saw impending.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Caleb Trench sat staring into the fire.
“I’m afraid Colonel Royall will suffer heavily,” he
said; “he wasn’t so deeply involved, it appears,
but—as soon as he heard of the wide-spread ruin—he
offered to redeem a number of Jacob Eaton’s
pledges. His offer was accepted, the papers signed,
and now all these claims are rolling up. I honor him
for what he did,” Trench added simply; “it was
noble, but it was quixotic. I fear greatly for the
consequences.”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney settled himself back in his winged
chair and put the tips of his fingers together. “I
think likely he’ll escape it all,” he remarked gravely;
“he was unconscious twenty minutes to-day and
David isn’t as young as he was. He may be fortunate
enough to pass beyond this trouble.”</p>

<p>Trench moved uneasily, then he rose and stood,
his back to the fire. “And Miss Royall?” he said.</p>

<p>“She’s with her father,” replied Dr. Cheyney.
“Caleb, I never saw anything so fine as she was at
your trial.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>Trench was silent for a moment, and his face in
the shadow eluded scrutiny. “I would have given
my right hand to save her that notoriety,” he said
at last.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney looked thoughtful, but there was the
shadow of a smile in the depths of his mild eyes.
“You’ve never asked me to finish my testimony,”
he remarked. “I’m in the possession of a secret that
would clear up all this scandal about poor little
Sammy; I’ve waited three weeks and you don’t ask
me. I wonder if you’re human, Caleb Trench?”</p>

<p>Trench swung around and faced him. The expression
of his face, its power and its mastery and
self-control had never been more poignant. “Dr.
Cheyney,” he said, “it doesn’t concern me; let them
say what they please.”</p>

<p>“On my soul!” said Dr. Cheyney, “I won’t tell
you! You’re too pesky proud to live. I reckon
they’ll say all you want and more too, young man.”</p>

<p>“Let them!” said Caleb.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was two days after this that Judge Hollis came
into Caleb’s little office and found him at work
in his shirt sleeves. The table and desk were
covered with papers and open telegrams. The judge
eyed the place critically. Order showed in the neat
pigeonholes and the rows of packed shelves.</p>

<p>“In two years you’ll have me beat,” remarked the
judge, “then I’ll take down my shingle.”</p>

<p>Caleb smiled wearily. “You forget that this only
shows how far behindhand I am,” he replied; “you
were never on trial for your life, Judge.”</p>

<p>The old man shook his head. “No,” he said, “and
I was never the most conspicuous figure in the State.
Caleb, you’ve been threatened?”</p>

<p>“Some letters, yes,” the younger man admitted,
without emotion, “from cranks, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the judge flatly, “there’s feeling.
Some of these ignorant people have got a notion
that your campaign against Eaton, your attack on
his company, destroyed his credit and drove him to
the wall. They’ve got the idea that he’d have saved
himself, and their investments, if you’d let him be.
They’re wild about it; money loss goes to the quick,
when a man can’t pay for his bacon he wants a scapegoat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
The better sort know it’s not your doing, and,
I’ll say it for ’em, the newspapers have been decent,
but there’s feeling, Caleb; you’d better go armed.”</p>

<p>Caleb laughed. “Judge, I was bred a Quaker. I
only used my pistol here in self-defense; I never
went out with one in my pocket in my life.”</p>

<p>The judge rubbed his chin. “You’d better now,”
he remarked shortly.</p>

<p>Caleb leaned back in his chair and looked out of
the window thoughtfully. “I wonder what my
father would have said to his son carrying weapons?”
he reflected, amused.</p>

<p>“Good deal better than to get a hole in you,” the
judge retorted; “you know how to use it!”</p>

<p>Trench colored. “My blood was up, Judge,” he
said, “a mob’s a cowardly thing; I never felt such
disgust in my life.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” ejaculated the judge eloquently.</p>

<p>Caleb smiled involuntarily. “I don’t think there’s
any danger,” he said pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Of course not!” snapped the judge. “Trench,
why don’t you clear up this talk about that kid in
yonder? Cheyney knows who the father is; make
him tell. By the Lord Harry,” he added, thumping
the table with his fist, “I wanted it out in court.”</p>

<p>Caleb Trench turned slightly away, his face inscrutable.
“Judge,” he said, “I wouldn’t stir a
finger. I took in the kid just as I took in the dog.
Let them talk.”</p>

<p>The judge stared at him angrily, uncomprehendingly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
“I reckon you’re a crank,” he said; “you’re
worse than David Royall.”</p>

<p>“How is the colonel to-day?” Caleb asked, to
change the subject; he knew, for he had asked Dr.
Cheyney over the telephone.</p>

<p>“He’s better,” retorted the judge shortly; “you’re
not, and you’ll be worse if you don’t watch out.
There are snakes in the grass.”</p>

<p>Caleb smiled. “Judge,” he said, “if I listened to
any one in the world I would to you; I’m not
ungrateful.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” retorted the judge, and jammed his
hat down harder than usual.</p>

<p>At the door he stopped and waved his cane aggressively.
“I’ve warned you,” he said harshly, “and
if you were not an idiot, sir, you’d make Cheyney
speak. It’s some dratted crank of his about his
professional honor!”</p>

<p>“How about a lawyer’s, Judge?” asked Caleb,
amused.</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted the old man, and went out
and slammed the door.</p>

<p>Later that afternoon business took Caleb up to
Cresset’s Corners to see Aaron Todd. He had been
twice to Broad Acres to inquire for Colonel Royall
without seeing Diana; he had refrained from asking
for her. Dr. Cheyney had told him that she would
not leave her father, and he knew that, as yet, he
could scarcely express all he felt about the ordeal
of her testimony. He had forborne to account for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
that time to spare her the publicity of the witness-stand,
and his very silence only made her evidence
more significant. To see her and thank her without
saying all that was in his heart was no easy matter.
He had driven back his love for her, and battled
against it, denied it a right to exist, because he knew
that she regarded him as an inferior. But now, by
her own act, when she acknowledged him as her
friend and defended him at the cost of a hundred
uncharitable rumors, it seemed that he might have
misunderstood her natural pride of birth and affluence
for a repugnance to his poverty. When their
eyes met in the court-room with that inevitable
shock of mutual feeling that leaves a startled certainty
behind it, he had felt almost sure that she loved
him. But since then he had plunged back again into
his old doubts, arguing that her testimony had been
merely a matter of duty, and that his own feeling
had deceived him into imagining that her heart was
likewise touched. He had no right to suppose that
her evidence was otherwise than involuntary, the
exact rendering of the truth to save a man’s life. If
he went further and believed that she loved him, he
was overstepping the bounds of probability. Love
is an involuntary passion, says an honored moralist:
we cannot help it, but we can starve it out. And
Caleb had set himself to starve it out but it may be
said that he found the battle an unequal one. He
was like a man who had walked persistently, and of
his own choice, in a sullen fog, and saw suddenly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
through a vast rent in the mist, the golden sunshine
of another day. The fog of his doubts and his unbelief
had lifted on that afternoon in court, only to
settle down again in denser gloom.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the tumult of battle went on. He was
once more leading the anti-Eaton forces, leading them
triumphantly now, and crash after crash in financial
circles told of the complete collapse of that bubble
which had been called the Eaton Investment Company.
There is no keener incentive to anger than
money loss, as Judge Hollis said; there were many
who cried out against Caleb as the instigator of an
investigation which had culminated in almost universal
ruin in the county. The wave of popularity
that had swept around him at the hour of his acquittal
was receding, and leaving him beached on the sands
of public criticism.</p>

<p>None of these things, however, greatly troubled the
man himself; he pursued his course with the same
determination with which he had begun it. He had
foreseen unpopularity and met it with unshaken
purpose. What immediately concerned him was his
plain duty, and his experience at the time of his
arrest and trial had inspired him with a pessimistic
unbelief in the clamorous plaudits of the masses.
For, in a day, he had dropped from the height of the
popularity of his Cresset speech to the degradation
of a despised and suspected prisoner. Like all those
who have tasted the vicissitudes of life, they had no
longer the same terrors for him. He was stronger in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
his position now than ever, his reputation was already
growing beyond the borders of the State, but he was
less popular in doing an unwelcome duty than he had
been as the exponent of the new theories of investigation.
A vivid recollection of all that had passed
in the last few weeks stirred his mind as he walked up
the trail to Broad Acres. Shot, who had become
devoted to Sammy, had followed him only a little
way and then returned to his new playmate, so Caleb
was alone. He had avoided the road and ascended
the trail, because the woodland solitudes left his
mind free to his own meditations, and the bleak and
russet aspect of the woods, the naked trees and the
brown leaves underfoot, in some delicate and subtle
manner, harmonized with his sober mood. The keen
blue of the river below him and the purple of the distant
hills rested his eyes. He swung on, his long easy
stride carrying him fast, and in a few moments he
saw Kingdom-Come leaning on the fence at the side
of the Broad Acres vegetable garden. The negro
was stripping the leaves off a cauliflower and gazing
curiously at Caleb Trench.</p>

<p>“How’s the colonel?” Caleb asked, stopping a
moment, and his glance wandered toward the old
house where even the jingo tree had dropped its last
golden leaves upon the grass.</p>

<p>“He’s bettah, suh,” said Kingdom, “so de doctah
says. I’se not so sure; seems mighty po’ly ter me,
Mistah Trench.”</p>

<p>Caleb remembered that a negro never admits perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
health and felt reassured. “Say to the colonel
that I would be glad to be of any service to him,” he
said, and wanted to add Diana’s name but restrained
the impulse.</p>

<p>“I sho will, Mistah Trench,” said Kingdom. “Cool
day, suh, gwine ter be cold, too; de moon dun
hangs ter de north.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s an infallible sign,” smiled
Trench, as he turned away.</p>

<p>“Fo’ de Lawd, ain’t yo’ nebber heerd dat?” Kingdom
patted the cauliflower affectionately, having
squared off the remaining green petals. “De moon
hung north means cold, suh, an’ south et means hot,
jest ez sho’ ez yo’ gets er disappintment ef yo hangs
annything on er doah knob.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to remember both signs,” said Caleb
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Miss Diana’s up in de woods,” volunteered the
negro, with that innocence which sits so naturally
on a black face.</p>

<p>Caleb made no reply this time. He walked on,
choosing the road, nor did he look again toward the
house. He had the unpleasant consciousness that
the negro had read him as easily as he himself read
more profound riddles in the exact sciences.</p>

<p>He passed the last confines of Broad Acres and
turned, involuntarily, into the trail which led him to
the spot where he had stood months before with
Diana and told her that he loved her. Afterwards
he had wondered at himself, that his pride had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
revolted at the confession, yet he had never altogether
repented of it. There had been some comfort
in telling her the truth, the naked truth. He recalled
the look in her eyes in the court-room! He put that
thought steadily away and walked rapidly on. Another
turn would show him the long glimpse of Paradise
Ridge. Before him the trail ascended under
sweeping hemlock boughs, beside him the brush rose
breast high. Once he thought he heard a crackle of
twigs and turned sharply, but there was no one in
sight. Then, looking ahead, he saw Diana Royall.</p>

<p>She was coming down the path alone, and the sunset
sky behind her darkened the outlines of her tall
young figure until it was silhouetted against the sky.
He noticed that her dress was gray and that her large
black hat framed the fair oval of her face. As she
drew nearer he was aware of the gravity and sweetness
of her expression. As yet the distance was too
great for speech and he did not hurry his step; there
was, perhaps, more joy in the thought of this meeting
than in its accomplishment. But he saw nothing but
this picture, the mellow sky behind it, the hemlock
boughs above.</p>

<p>Then, quite suddenly, he felt a stinging shock and
heard a loud report, as he reeled and fell back into
darkness, the vision going out as though a great black
sponge had effaced life itself.</p>

<p>Diana rushed to him; she had seen more than he,
but no warning of hers would have reached him in
time, and now she did not think of herself, or of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
possible danger. She dropped on her knees beside
him and bent down to look into his face. His eyes
were closed; she could not tell if he breathed, and
even while she looked she saw a dark red stain on the
breast of his coat. She uttered a low cry, and tried
to raise his head on her arm. She realized at last the
power that his very presence exerted, the influence
that he had had over her from the very first, that had
made her yield again and again to a sense of his
mastery. She loved him. She no longer tried to
deny it to herself, and she felt that it was to her
shame that no accusation against him could shake
her in her devotion. Whatever he had been she
loved him; whatever his faults, in her eyes there
must be, there would be, an extenuation; whatever
his sins she could forgive them! Class prejudice
counted for nothing; she was his, and nothing in the
world mattered to her in that one blind moment of
agony for his life.</p>

<p>“Oh, God,” she prayed softly, “spare me this!”</p>

<p>She was in despair, his head lay heavy on her arm,
his blood stained her hands, and she was alone. The
wind stirred and a dead leaf fluttered down. How
still it was! To leave him and run for help seemed
her only resource, but to leave him! She could not
do it! She thought him dead, but not a tear came to
her dry eyes; she looked down at his white face and
marked the lines of trouble and anxiety, the resolution
of the locked mouth and jaw. Did he breathe?
“Oh, God!” she prayed again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>She remembered, too, that it was here that he had
told her so abruptly that he loved her. She, too, remembered
that moment in the court-room, and a
dry sob of anguish shook her from head to foot. She
bent down suddenly and kissed him, but she could
not shed a tear.</p>

<p>Then, in the stillness, she heard wheels, and laying
him gently down, she ran through the underbrush
and reached the road just below the fork. It was
Dr. Cheyney’s old buggy, and she cried to him that
Caleb Trench was shot and lying wounded in the
trail. The old man got down and followed her without
a word, his lips set. They came up the trail and
found Trench lying as she had left him; he did not
seem to breathe. Dr. Cheyney knelt down and made
a brief examination, then he looked for something to
stop the bleeding. Diana gave him a long light
scarf she had worn around her throat; she was quick
and deft in her touch and worked steadily to help the
doctor; she had mastered herself. The old man
fumbling over Caleb drew out a bit of blood-stained
paper and glanced at it. Then he went on with his
task.</p>

<p>“Is he living?” Diana murmured at last.</p>

<p>“I reckon I wouldn’t do this if he wasn’t,” snapped
the doctor. Then he rose from his knees. “You
get into the buggy, Diana, and drive down to the
house for help; telephone to the hospital, we’ll want
a stretcher.”</p>

<p>“He’s coming to our house,” said Diana.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>Dr. Cheyney gave her a grim look. “All right,”
he said, “but a stretcher and two men. I wonder
who in hell did this?” he added fiercely.</p>

<p>Diana had risen from her knees. “Zeb Bartlett,”
she said. “I saw him too late to cry a warning.”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney’s face changed sharply. He handed
the paper he had taken from Trench to Diana. “I
reckon that’s yours—now run!” he commanded.</p>

<p>It seemed hours to Diana before she got help there.
In reality it was twenty minutes. The negroes improvised
a stretcher and carried Caleb solemnly down
the hill and across the long lawns. Diana had gone
ahead to prepare the great west room for him, and
when they brought him in, still unconscious, the
white bed was ready and the long table for the operation,
and she had telephoned for another surgeon
from the hospital. At eight o’clock that night they
had found the bullet and removed it, and there was a
fighting chance for life.</p>

<p>Diana, who had waited on the stairs to know the
worst, said nothing. In her own room she had looked
at the blood-stained paper which Dr. Cheyney had
so strangely given her. Across it was written her
own name in her bold handwriting. She looked at it
strangely, and then with a stinging sense of shame;
it was the receipt for six cents with which she had
mocked him long ago. And he had carried it all this
time! Diana laid her head down on her arms and
burst into tears.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE agony of the night and the ensuing morning
left Diana feeling lifeless. Her only consolation
was in the fact that her father was
able to be up and in his chair, and by nine o’clock
they had received a message that poor Jinny Eaton
showed signs of recovering her senses. Of Jacob
nothing was heard, to her great relief. A trial and
imprisonment would have capped the climax of
Colonel Royall’s mortification. She did not know
that Dr. Cheyney had saved her that. Nor did she
tell the doctor, nor any one, that she and Kingdom-Come
had gone down the night before to Caleb’s
house to see to the welfare of Sammy and the dog.</p>

<p>She had found Aunt Charity there and bribed her
heavily to stay over night, but Diana had no faith in
Charity and another project was shaping itself in her
mind. She would have liked to consult her father,
but she could not trouble him and the trials of the
last few months had been developing Diana. All that
was sweet and malleable in the girl’s nature had crystallized
into greater strength, and a greater sweetness,
too; she was no longer a girl, but a woman, and her
greatness of heart showed in the breadth of her charity.
She had sat down in the old leather chair in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
Caleb’s office and lifted Jean Bartlett’s child to her
knee without a shudder of repulsion at that shameful
story. Instead, she touched the child’s head tenderly
and crooned over it, womanlike. Oh, if Caleb
could have seen her in the old worn chair!</p>

<p>Her own thoughts were filled with him to the exclusion
of everything else on earth. She was almost
frightened at the strength of her feeling for him, he
seemed even to put aside her anxiety for her father,
his life was her one passionate petition to Heaven.
And she was conscious now that she wanted not only
his life, but his love.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney had installed a trained nurse, and there
was a young surgeon from the hospital in charge.
Diana’s only privilege was to go to the door and inquire,
and wait upon the doctors. She did this to
the exclusion of the negroes, who considered it their
duty to remonstrate with Miss Diana. In the afternoon
Dr. Cheyney told her that Caleb had borne the
operation so well that there was much hope. Then
Diana went out bareheaded into the deserted grounds
and wandered about them aimlessly, trying to regain
her natural composure.</p>

<p>They had arrested Zeb Bartlett, and he had given
his sister’s disgrace as his reason for shooting Caleb,—a
belated vengeance, but one that suited the public
appetite for scandal. Diana had heard it unmoved.
In that dreadful moment when he lay at her feet,
seemingly dead, she had forgotten Jean Bartlett, and
even now, nothing in the world mattered to her but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
his life. Her face flushed with shame for her own indifference,
the deadening of every instinct but her
agonizing anxiety for his life. She had learned that
love is greater than judgment and as great as mercy.
She walked slowly along the path between the box-bordered
flower-beds; here and there a late rose
bloomed in the autumn sunshine, and in the arbor
the great ungathered clusters of grapes hung purple,
sweetened by frost.</p>

<p>Before her was the same vista which showed from
the Shut Room, and she saw the river. That view recalled
the room and the days her father had sat there
before his illness, and she thought of her mother with
that vague sweet regret with which we think of the
unknown dead whom we would have loved. Then
she looked up and saw a woman coming toward her
from the gate. She was a stranger, yet Diana was
instinctively aware of a familiarity in her bearing
and her gait. She stood waiting for her approach,
looking keenly at her face, which was beautiful
though it looked a little haggard and worn. The
woman came on, looking eagerly, in her turn, at
Diana. For one so apparently wealthy and at ease,
her manner was almost timid; there was a hesitation
even in its eagerness as though she feared her
welcome. The girl saw it and was faintly surprised.
In another moment the stranger was in front of her,
and she saw that she breathed like a person who had
been running or was in great trepidation. She stopped,
and involuntarily her hand went to her heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>“You are Diana Royall,” she said abruptly.</p>

<p>Diana looked at her gently, vaguely alarmed,
though at what she could not divine. Her first
thought, strangely enough, was a message from
Jacob, and her manner grew cold. “Yes,” she said
quietly, “I am Diana Royall; can I do anything for
you?”</p>

<p>The stranger hesitated; then her natural manner,
which was full of self-command, asserted itself. “I
am Mrs. Fenwick. I know you do not know me,
but”—she glanced down the long garden path—“will
you walk with me a moment?” she said. “I
have something to say to you.”</p>

<p>Diana assented reluctantly. Her own heart was
behind the half-closed shutters in that upper room,
and at another time she would have thought the request
at once remarkable and unwarranted. They
turned and walked together down the garden path,
and as Diana stooped to unlatch the wicket gate
which shut off the rose garden from the larger grounds,
her companion shaded her eyes with her hand and
looked off toward the river.</p>

<p>“There have been some changes in this view, I
think,” she said abruptly, her eyes on the landscape;
“the river was more obscured by trees.”</p>

<p>“The railroad cut cleared a bit of forest and gave
us a finer view,” replied Diana, and then she glanced
quickly at her visitor, who was evidently familiar with
the prospect.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” said Mrs. Fenwick softly, “this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
view is familiar; it is the same that one sees from
your mother’s old room.”</p>

<p>Diana stood still, with her hand on the wicket.
“Did you know my mother?” she asked quickly.</p>

<p>The older woman turned and looked fully at her.
She had been very beautiful in her first youth, and
Diana was conscious of a charm at once subtle and
persuasive. “Is your mother dead?” she asked
gently.</p>

<p>The girl was deeply perplexed. “She died twenty
years ago,” she replied.</p>

<p>“She died twenty years ago?” her visitor repeated
dreamily, looking away again. “It may be so! She
may have died to this life here, to this place, to these
people, but believe me, Diana, she is not dead.”</p>

<p>They had passed through the wicket and were
standing on the lower lawn. Instinctively Diana
drew further away from her; she did not understand
her, and she disliked her familiarity, but as yet she
was unalarmed. “My mother died in that room up
there,” she said, with gentle dignity, “and my father
has mourned her ever since, and has taught me to
mourn her, too.”</p>

<p>A deep flush passed over Mrs. Fenwick’s face, and
her hands trembled a little as they hung clasped before
her. Diana, watching her, noticed it and noticed
the grace of her pose. The girl thought that the elder
woman never forgot herself, that her actions, even her
gestures, were considered, that there was something
artificial in them, yet her emotion was evident and
unfeigned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>“It was good of him,” said Mrs. Fenwick slowly,
“it was, I suppose, a beautiful idea, but it was an
untruthful one. Diana, I am your mother.”</p>

<p>Diana thought her mad. She drew away from her
again, and this time with instinctive repugnance, yet
she was pitiful. This was evidently a delusion; the
woman was insane and to be pitied and dealt with
compassionately.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken, Mrs. Fenwick,” she said gently;
“my mother is dead.”</p>

<p>“I tell you that I am your mother!” cried Letty,
with sudden passion. “Your mother never died; she
was wicked, she ran away from your father and from
you with another man. I am that wretched woman,
Diana; forgive me!”</p>

<p>“I think you are quite mad,” said Diana coldly; “I
am sure you are.”</p>

<p>“Good God, she will not believe me!” Letty exclaimed;
“how wonderful the web of deception must
have been; I did not know before that David Royall
was a liar!”</p>

<p>“Silence!” Diana towered. “Do not dare to say
one word against my father here!” she commanded.</p>

<p>“Ah, it was for this he wrought so well!” said
Mrs. Fenwick bitterly, “to shut out the sinner.
Diana, forgive me, look at me; is there no likeness
in my face to my own picture? There was a large
one of me in my first youth. Don’t you know me?”</p>

<p>Diana was very pale. “There is no picture of my
mother,” she said deliberately, “and I do not believe
you are my mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>Letty Fenwick looked at her despairingly. She had
come with the mad impulse of affection, long pent up
in her warped and passionate heart; she had wanted
her daughter, and she had never dreamed that her
daughter would not want her. That, instead, the
girl’s outraged feelings would leap up in defense of
the deserted father; that, never having known a living
mother, her mind had created an image at once
beautiful and noble, and that this revelation shocked
every instinct of her nature. The older woman was
vividly aware of the girl’s instinctive aversion, of her
reluctance to acknowledge her dawning conviction,
and in that very reluctance Letty read her own exile
and defeat. She was, indeed, dead. Colonel Royall’s
curious way of guarding her secret from her daughter
had absolutely estranged her forever. He had accomplished
through forbearance and love what he
could never have accomplished through passion and
revenge; she was forever dead to her own child. This,
then, was the punishment. She stood looking at Diana
in a kind of dull despair.</p>

<p>“You are very beautiful,” she said, “more beautiful
than I was at your age, Diana, and I thank Heaven
that you will not be like me. You are stronger, braver,
less foolish. I was both foolish and wicked; I deserted
you, but, oh, my child, I suffered for it! And
I am asking for so little now,—your love, that I may
see you sometimes, your forgiveness!”</p>

<p>Her voice was full of pleading; it had a sweetness,
too, at once touching and eloquent. Diana returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
her look sadly. Conviction had been growing in her
heart; a hundred little things sprang to mind to confirm
this strange story,—hints, suggestions of Jinny
Eaton’s, inexplicable actions of her father. It might
be true, but she was appalled at the stillness of her
heart. She had loved her mother’s memory, but,
confronted with this strange woman, she found no response.
She battled against conviction; the shattering
of her beautiful dream of an ideal mother was
bitter indeed.</p>

<p>“I cannot believe it!” she exclaimed, “I cannot
believe it!”</p>

<p>Her mother drew a long breath. “You mean you
will not believe it,” she said quietly, “because you
would rather repudiate the sinner! I do not blame
you. But it is true, I am your mother.” She broke
off, her parched lips quivered, but she shed no tears.
“Diana,” she said after a moment, “thank God that
you are not like me—and forgive me.”</p>

<p>“I cannot believe you!” reiterated Diana.</p>

<p>But as she spoke they both saw Dr. Cheyney crossing
the lawn to the house, and her mother beckoned
to him. The old man came reluctantly, instinctively
aware of the cause of the summons.</p>

<p>“Dr. Cheyney,” Mrs. Fenwick said with forced
composure, “tell Diana that I am her mother.”</p>

<p>The old man stood with his hand at his chin; he
was very pale. Diana looked up and met his eyes,
and a slow painful blush went up to her hair.</p>

<p>“She is your mother,” said the doctor abruptly, and
turned his back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>As he walked away Letty Fenwick held out both
hands pleadingly. “Diana,” she said softly, “will
you kiss me?”</p>

<p>The hot tears came into Diana’s eyes and fell slowly
on her pale cheeks. “Mother!” she said, in a choked
voice.</p>

<p>Her mother caught her in her arms and kissed her.
“My child!” she murmured, “my child, can you forgive
me?”</p>

<p>Diana could not speak, her mother was weeping.
“Dear girl,” she said, “I’m rich, I know your father’s
in trouble; let me help you, come to me. Oh, Diana,
I have longed for you!”</p>

<p>“And leave my father?” Diana’s pale face was
stern. “Leave him in sorrow and loss and loneliness?
Never!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said her mother bitterly, “you love him;
it is he who has all your heart!”</p>

<p>“I love him dearly,” said the girl, “now more than
ever.”</p>

<p>Letty turned away. “He is revenged!” she said
passionately.</p>

<p>Diana took a step nearer and laid her hand on her
arm. “Mother,” she said quietly, “I will try to love
you also, but remember that for twenty years I have
known only a beautiful image of you that his love
erected to save your memory for me. But I will try
to love you, I will certainly come to see you, I will
do anything I can, but only on one condition—”</p>

<p>“My God!” cried Letty passionately, “you make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
a condition? You bargain with me—I must beg for
and buy your love?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Diana, “love you cannot buy, but I
will do all I can, if you will promise me never to let
this great sorrow mar his life again, if you will help
me guard him, if you will remember how beautifully
he shielded your name for your child.”</p>

<p>Letty covered her face with her hands. “Alas!”
she said, “you have found a way to punish me, but
I promise, Diana.”</p>

<p>“He has been ill,” Diana went on hurriedly, “he
has been in trouble, he needs me every moment, and
I love him dearly; for his sake, because he wishes it,
I love you also.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fenwick still wept; involuntarily they turned
together and walked slowly toward the gate. “I
want to see him,” she said at last, “I want to ask his
forgiveness.”</p>

<p>“You have it,” said Diana simply. “I dare not
take you to him now, not to-night. Dr. Cheyney
must tell him, I—I cannot. But his forgiveness, it
is yours already.”</p>

<p>Letty looked back over the house. A thousand
haunting memories swept over her, and she shivered.
“Diana,” she said, “I am rich, I must help you
now.”</p>

<p>Diana’s pale face crimsoned; her father’s honor
had never seemed more sacred to her. “No,” she said
simply, “you cannot.”</p>

<p>Her mother met her eyes and turned away abruptly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
At the gate she put out her hand blindly and touched
Diana’s; the girl took it and kissed her.</p>

<p>“Forgive me—mother!” she murmured.</p>

<p>Letty clung to her a moment and then turned to
go out alone. “My sin has found me out!” she
cried bitterly, and dropped her veil over her face.</p>

<p>Diana, standing in the gate, watched her go away
alone. In her own anguish she was scarcely conscious
of the tragic picture of the exile. In moments so
poignant with feeling the great lesson of life is lost.
Diana had instinctively obeyed the impulse of love
and duty, for once irreconcilable with mercy, and
she was unaware that she had been an instrument of
one woman’s punishment. She went back to the
house and found her father alone. Every impulse
of her heart clamored to tell him that she knew, to
sympathize, to go to him for comfort, as she had all
her life. But he looked up as she entered.</p>

<p>“Diana,” he said gently, “you look to-day as your
mother did at your age.”</p>

<p>Diana slipped down on the arm of his chair and
threw her arms around his neck. “Was she beautiful,
father?” she asked quietly.</p>

<p>“Very, dear, like you,” he said; for twenty years
he had woven his simple romance.</p>

<p>Diana laid her cheek against his. “Thank you,
dear,” she said, “for her memory—we will always
love it together.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Dr. Cheyney came down-stairs he
found Colonel Royall alone, and he was
able to reassure him about the patient in
the west room.</p>

<p>“He’s going to live,” he said; “he’s had a close
squeak, but he’ll pull through unless something else
happens. Lucky thing, too, for Zeb Bartlett.”</p>

<p>“That poor boy is an idiot,” said the colonel reflectively.
“I can’t see what he did it for?”</p>

<p>“Mad at Caleb for one thing,” said Dr. Cheyney,
“has been for some time because he couldn’t beg
from him all the while. Then he was set on, had a
pistol given him, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” exclaimed the colonel, startled.</p>

<p>“Reckon so,” said the doctor mildly; he did not
add that in the Commonwealth attorney’s office it
was known to be Jacob Eaton’s pistol; “got some
fool notion about his sister.”</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty bad business,” said Colonel
Royall.</p>

<p>“Quite so!” agreed the doctor dryly.</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened and Diana came
in; she was leading a child by the hand, and a dog
followed her. Dr. Cheyney took off his spectacles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>“I’ll be jiggered!” he said abruptly.</p>

<p>Colonel Royall smiled faintly. “She would have
her way,” he said apologetically. “I objected, but
Diana rules the roost.”</p>

<p>Diana’s sad eyes met the doctor’s with a flash of
humor. “I shan’t let you stay if you worry him,”
she said.</p>

<p>The doctor held out his hand to Sammy, but Sammy
refused to leave Diana; he clung to her skirts and hid
his face in the folds.</p>

<p>“Seems to take kindly to you, Diana,” remarked
the doctor.</p>

<p>She blushed. “He’s friendly enough,” she explained,
“if you give him pennies.”</p>

<p>“Wants a penny!” said Sammy instantly, his
tousled yellow head appearing from Diana’s skirt.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney explored his pockets and found a new
one. “Come and get it,” he said.</p>

<p>Sammy moved over slowly and doubtfully, taking
two steps backward to one forward every time.</p>

<p>“Suspicious, eh?” said the doctor, displaying the
penny at a nearer view.</p>

<p>Sammy fell upon it and ran back to Diana, clasping
it close in his fist.</p>

<p>“An embryo financier,” said the colonel, musing,
“and the dog isn’t what one would call a prize-winner,”
he added.</p>

<p>“Caleb took ’em both in,” said the doctor; “he’s
made that way. After a while we’ll understand
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>“Some people say that he had good reason to take
in the boy,” remarked Colonel Royall without malice.</p>

<p>“Father,” said Diana, “I wouldn’t have believed
it of you, talking scandal, and he’s our guest!”</p>

<p>“That’s right, keep him down, Diana,” said the
doctor; “the fact is there’s nothing so cruel as
people’s tongues. Now I know Sammy’s father and
sometimes I’m tempted, sore tempted, to go and
post it by the wayside.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would!” said Diana with sudden
feeling, “it’s only just to—to Mr. Trench.”</p>

<p>“That’s so—she’s right, William,” said her
father, half smiling.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney reflected; his lined old face lost
some of its whimsical humor, but it gained in sympathy
and strength. “I’ve held my tongue to shield
others,” he said at last, “to spare the feelings of a
family I love. What would you do about it, David?
Do you think it’s right to plaster a scandal on to
folks?”</p>

<p>Diana glanced quickly at her father, keenly aware
of his concealment and that this all must touch him
to the quick. The old man looked very old indeed.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s right to let the thing attach
itself to Mr. Trench if you know he’s innocent,” he
said at length.</p>

<p>“I reckon he’d be satisfied to be justified here,”
said Dr. Cheyney, his eyes resting on Diana as she
bent down and caressed Sammy.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to make it public to be of any use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
to him now,” said Colonel Royall, “the other story
has been in every newspaper in the State.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Dr. Cheyney, “but, David, it
will come home to you here. Sammy’s father is
Jacob Eaton.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a few moments, and then
Colonel Royall said: “It is singular that that young
man has managed to inflict so many mortifications
upon his family. Poor Jinny! She was always
quoting him as a pink of propriety.”</p>

<p>“The result of a mollycoddle,” said the doctor
shortly. “Now you know the facts, David, and it’s
up to you. Shall I tell them?”</p>

<p>Colonel Royall meditated. “Poor Jinny!” he said
again, “she’s been so proud of him, and now—one
blow on another, no wonder she’s given up. Poor
Jinny!”</p>

<p>“Father,” said Diana, “we’ve no right to consider
even Cousin Jinny, only Mr. Trench.”</p>

<p>The force of her conviction showed through her
reserve. She felt that Caleb Trench had borne enough
at the hands of their relatives, and that he should be
the scapegoat of one of Jacob’s sins was too much.</p>

<p>Colonel Royall raised his bowed head. “She’s
right, William,” he said, pathetically resigned; “tell
it to the world.”</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyney rose. “Well, it has seemed like
kicking a man who was down,” he remarked, “but,
as Diana says, there is Caleb Trench.”</p>

<p>Diana followed him out into the hall. “Dr. Cheyney,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
she said, “why did no one tell me about my
mother?”</p>

<p>The old man put his hand on her shoulder.
“Diana,” he said, “it was David’s wish, and we all
respected it. I wish”—he paused—“I wish Letty
had not come back. But she wanted to see you.
Natural enough, I reckon, only she ought to have
been natural in that way at first.”</p>

<p>“It was cruel not to tell me,” said Diana, “but I
will not tell him so—dear father!”</p>

<p>The doctor looked at her thoughtfully. “You’re
a good girl, Diana,” he said.</p>

<p>They walked together to the door. “Doctor, do
you believe that—that my mother is unhappy?”
she asked at last. “I could not go to her: I will not
leave him.”</p>

<p>“Unhappy? No, child, not more so than others,”
said the old man. “She’s got to bear her burden,
Diana, that’s the law of life. Don’t you fret; she’s
rich, courted, influential, I’ve known it for years.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how she could treat my father so!”
cried the girl.</p>

<p>“Thank God, you never will!” said the doctor
with conviction.</p>

<p>“She wants to see him,” the girl faltered, “I—you—”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him,” said William Cheyney.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">COLONEL ROYALL was sitting by the great
fireplace in his library. Daylight was failing
fast at the windows, and the long bough of a
hemlock sweeping across the one toward the west
was outlined against the whitening sky. The colonel
watched it as it swayed. Once and awhile he turned
and looked toward the door, his fine old hands tightening
on the carved arms of his chair.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago he had seen her last in this room,
and he was to see her again to-night. A singular
feeling tightened about his heart. When we have
watched through a long vigil with a great and agonizing
sorrow, when we have rebelled against it, and
battled and fought with the air, in our vain outcry
against its injustice, when we have longed and wept
and prayed for release in vain, and then, at last, have
laid it in its ashes and stood beside that open grave,
which yawns sooner or later in every past, then—the
coming of its ghost is bitter with the bitterness of
death.</p>

<p>It was the coming of the ghost for which Colonel
Royall waited in the gathering dusk, the ghost who
must walk over the white ashes of his love and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
outraged honor. For twenty years he had hidden
the mother’s sin from the daughter, he had made her
memory sweet to her child. And his requital? She
had tried to rob him of that one comfort of his life,
to take his daughter away, to estrange them in his
hour of need. In that hour even that gentle and
simple heart knew its own bitterness. He recalled
every incident of that unhappy past, he recalled her
beauty and her indifference; again and again he had
questioned himself, had the fault been his? He had
loved much and forgiven much, yet it might be that
he had given her cause for weariness. Had the narrow
routine of life which made his happiness fretted
her? If he had let her spread her butterfly wings in
other and gayer climes, would she have been more
content to return at last? Perhaps,—he did not
know.</p>

<p>Fallacious thought! No human being can hold
captive another’s will except by that one magic
talisman, and love for David Royall had never really
lived in his wife’s heart. Marriage to some women
is a brilliant fête, and a preventive of the reproach
which they fondly believe would attach to them in
single-blessedness; marriage is a poultice for the ills
of society, and the latch-key to the social front door,
permitting more freedom of entrance and exit. Yet
it is a poultice which some are exceedingly anxious to
tear off after a short application. The young and
beautiful Letty had tried it twice and was still suffering
from its effects; she had found it, in both instances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
grown cold and lumpy. Yet, so adorable had
been her youthful ways, so sweet and engaging her
manner, that this poor man, who had been the husband
of her youth, sat in the twilight, searching his
heart again for reasons for her discontent, no living
man having really mastered the ways of woman.</p>

<p>Night had fallen in the room, but the hemlock
bough was still outlined against the pane, for the
moon was rising. Presently, Kingdom-Come came
in softly and lit the tall old candelabrum on the mantel;
he was going on, with a noiseless step, to the
other lights, but the colonel stopped him.</p>

<p>“Has no one come yet?” he asked, as the negro,
leaving the lamps, arranged the fire.</p>

<p>“Not yet, Marse David.”</p>

<p>The colonel sighed inaudibly, and Kingdom retreated,
not over pleased. He, too, knew that some
one was expected. He had been with the Royalls
from his birth.</p>

<p>A light step came down the hall, and the colonel
held his breath. It was Diana, but she did not come
in; he heard her ascending the stairs. Then, in the
long silence, the hall clock chimed seven, the outer
door opened, and the colonel again heard steps come
across the tessellated floor of the old hall. His long
white hands tightened on the arms of his chair, the
ghost of his happiness was coming! He had loved
greatly, he was to look again on the face of her who,
loving him not, had betrayed him. Kingdom opened
the library door, stood aside for her, and closed it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
behind her. After twenty years they stood here
alone together—face to face.</p>

<p>The colonel shaded his eyes and looked into the
fire; the grave of his love yawned deep, a shudder
ran through him. Letitia had remained standing
by the door, the mature elegance of her figure, the
slightly bent head, recalled nothing when he finally
looked up. She had left him a mere girl; she returned
a worn woman of the world; the suggestions of her
past, gay and unhappy, seemed to penetrate the
classic mask of her still beautiful face. He knew her
even less than Dr. Cheyney. He made an attempt
to rise, failed and, sinking back, motioned her to a
seat.</p>

<p>She took it without a word, turning her face aside
to avoid the light of that one tall candelabrum. In
the old room, facing the man who had aged so greatly
in these heavy years, she was ashamed. She had
planned a dozen glib speeches, but her parched lips
refused to utter them. She put her ungloved hand
to her throat with a gesture that was like one who
struggled for breath, and Colonel Royall noticed the
flash of the jewels that she wore on her slender
fingers. A little thing will sometimes turn the balance
of thought, and the flash of Letty’s jewels
recalled her former husband to himself. He remembered
the divorce and her marriage. Between them
the white ashes of the past fell thick as snow. He
could dimly see through them the outlines of her
matured and hardened beauty, and the suggestions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
of that life in which he had played so small a part.
He thanked God devoutly that now they were face
to face he saw no likeness to Diana.</p>

<p>To the woman, his silence, his wan age, the lines
that suffering had mapped on his proud face, were
unendurable. She spoke at last, leaning toward him,
her clasped hands trembling on her knee. “David, I
have come to ask your forgiveness.”</p>

<p>The colonel returned her look with a new sad serenity.
“It’s a long time to wait,” he said.</p>

<p>She made a little involuntary movement, as if she
wanted to go to him, for she pitied him all at once,
with the same sweep of emotion that she had once abhorred
him, loving another man. “I have wanted it
for twenty years,” she said, and then added impulsively:
“I did not half understand how much you
loved me—until I heard how you had hidden it all
from Diana. At first I was angry, I thought you did
it to estrange her from the thought of her mother.
Then I realized that you were covering my disgrace,
and—and it has broken down my pride!” She
stopped with a little sob. “David, will you forgive
me?”</p>

<p>“I forgave you twenty years ago, Letitia,” he replied;
“you are Diana’s mother.”</p>

<p>The woman looked at him longingly. “She has
been—she is much to you?”</p>

<p>“She is all I have,” said Colonel Royall.</p>

<p>The shamed tears welled up in her splendid eyes,
her lip trembled like a child’s. “I have nothing!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
she sobbed wildly; “I am bankrupt!” and she
dropped her head on her hands.</p>

<p>He looked over at her with compassion, once he
passed his hand lightly across his eyes. He felt the
absolute restraint that comes to one whose love has
been lightly prized; he was nothing to her, it was not
for him to comfort her, while Letitia, cowering in
her chair, thought him cold-hearted, unforgiving, a
proud Royall to the core. Thus are we misinterpreted
by those who love us not.</p>

<p>“She cares nothing for me!” she sobbed, “you
have taught her to love a dead woman!”</p>

<p>“I would gladly have taught her to love her
mother,” the colonel said quietly, “but how could I
begin the lesson? By telling her that you had deserted
her?”</p>

<p>She rose at that and stood looking at him, through
her tears. “You have had your revenge!” she said
wildly, “you have had it a thousand times over in
that one reproach.”</p>

<p>“Letitia,” he said gently, “I never desired revenge.
I would have chastised the man who injured
me and dishonored you, if I could have done it without
dragging your name before the world. Other
revenge I never sought.”</p>

<p>“You have it!” she cried again bitterly, “you
have it; Diana despises me, I read it in her clear
eyes. You have brought her up to hate her mother’s
sin, so that when she knew it she would hate her
mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>The fine old hands tightened convulsively on the
carved arms of his chair. “Would you have had me
bring her up to condone such sins?” he asked her
sternly, his blue eyes kindling.</p>

<p>The shaft went home; its truth bit into her sore
heart. “No,” she breathed, hiding her face in her
hands, shaking from head to foot.</p>

<p>There was a long silence and then her voice. “I
can bear no more!”</p>

<p>He averted his eyes; her struggle hurt him deeply.
Now and then he saw her as she used to be; little reminders
of her youth, her early beauty, her gayety,
crept through the change in her. His own vision
was dimmed with tears. After a while she grew
more calm, and began to gather up her belongings,
her gloves, her purse, the boa that had slipped from
her shoulders, with those little familiar gestures that
are a part of a woman’s individuality, and yet all
women share them. She was gathering up the mantle
of her worldliness, putting on the worn mask of
conventionality.</p>

<p>“I am going,” she said, in a low voice that thrilled
with feeling, “I shall never see you again. Will you
forgive me, David? I sinned and—I have suffered,
I am suffering still.”</p>

<p>With an effort the old man rose and held out his
hand. In the gesture was all the stately courtesy of
his race and his traditions. “I forgave you long ago,”
he said.</p>

<p>She took his hand a moment, looked into his face,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
and read there the death warrant of every hope she
had that the trouble might be bridged, her daughter
come back to her. Her lips quivered and her shoulders
rose and fell with her quick breathing.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said, and passed slowly down
the room to the door.</p>

<p>A log fell on the hearth, and the blaze, shooting up a
tongue of flame, illumined the colonel’s gaunt figure
and whitened his face. At the door Letitia turned
and looked her last upon the man she had wronged,
who had forgiven her and yet, through the love of
his daughter, had so deeply smitten her.</p>

<p>She went out weeping and alone.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THREE weeks later Judge Hollis found Caleb
able to walk about the library. The wound
had healed, but the fever and the struggle for
life had told. His tall figure was more gaunt than
ever, and there were deep hollows in his cheeks. He
had prevailed with Judge Hollis to get the case
against Zeb Bartlett dismissed; the boy was half an
idiot, and the story of Jacob Eaton’s pistol and the
money that Jacob had given him before he fled, were
too choice bits to get into the newspapers. Dr. Cheyney
had put down the scandal which made Zeb’s shot
a revenge for Jean, and there was an effort now to
make things easy for poor Jinny Eaton, who had
gone to relatives in Virginia, still bewailing Jacob and
the influx of anarchists, which seemed to her to be
the real root of the trouble, as these incendiaries must
have stirred up the investigation which had wrecked
Jacob before he had time to recover his investments.
For years she spoke of these alien influences which
must be responsible even for the fluctuations on Wall
Street. Meanwhile, Jacob had escaped to South
America, and was heard of later as a financier in
Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>Judge Hollis announced his escape to Caleb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>“Got off with a cool million, I reckon,” said the
judge grimly; “by the Lord Harry, I wish I could
have laid him by the heels.”</p>

<p>Caleb smiled faintly. He was leaning back in a
big armchair by the fire, and the window before him
commanded a view of the mountain trail where he
had told Diana that he loved her. He had not yet
recovered from the miracle of finding himself under
Colonel Royall’s roof. He glanced now about the
room and noticed the fine air of simplicity and comfort;
the deep-seated leather chairs, the old mahogany
table, the portraits of Colonel Royall’s mother and
his grandfather in the uniform of the Colonial Army
on the walls. On the table was a great cluster of
roses from Diana’s hothouses. “I am glad Jacob
went,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“Of course!” said the judge with sarcasm, “it’s
my belief that William Cheyney warned him in time.
It’s like the old fool!”</p>

<p>“Dear Dr. Cheyney!” said Caleb warmly.</p>

<p>“Dear Dr. Fiddlesticks!” snapped the judge. “I
reckon I know William; we played alleys together
when we were boys and I licked him about as often
as he licked me.”</p>

<p>“The eternal bond of friendship,” smiled Caleb.</p>

<p>“He’s got off Jacob and you got off Zeb Bartlett,”
grumbled the judge, “and if you keep on, at your
present gait, you’ll be governor of this State in two
years. Then I suppose you and the doctor will empty
the penitentiary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>Caleb laughed. “I’ll get your help,” he said,
“your heart isn’t as hard as you pretend it is.”</p>

<p>“A good many people think I haven’t got one,”
said the judge; “I reckon they don’t let you see the
papers yet?”</p>

<p>Caleb shook his head.</p>

<p>The judge grinned. “And yesterday was the first
Tuesday in November. Drat ’em, I call that hard!
I’ll tell you,” he leaned forward, his fingers on Caleb’s
knee, “the Republicans carried the State by a plurality
of ten thousand; Peter Mahan is elected.”</p>

<p>Caleb’s amazement kept him silent.</p>

<p>“Your fault, sir!” said the judge triumphantly,
“you ripped the Democracy in two, showed the machine,
convicted the governor. By the Lord Harry,
boy, I voted the Republican ticket!”</p>

<p>Caleb wrung the old man’s hand. “Now I know
you love me, Judge!” he said.</p>

<p>It was then that the door opened and Diana appeared
on the threshold, bearing a little tray, Sammy
at her skirts and Shot trailing behind her. “Judge,”
she said, “the doctor’s orders—twenty minutes and
no politics!”</p>

<p>The judge got up and reached for his hat and cane.
“I’m guilty, Diana!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll have to go,” she said, and smiled
across at the patient.</p>

<p>It was only the third time Caleb had seen her, and
he did not know how often she had hung over him in
agony when he lay unconscious. Diana, meeting his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
eyes, turned crimson. She remembered, with a sudden
panic, that she had kissed him when she thought
that he was dying!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the judge went out grumbling. He
was too full of the election to be silenced, and went
to drink a mint julep with Colonel Royall. Diana
came back into the library leading Sammy. The dog
had bounded to his master and lay now on the hearthrug.
Caleb stood by his chair, pale but transformed.</p>

<p>“You must not stand,” ordered Diana, as she set
down the little tray on the table and began to arrange
his luncheon. “Kingdom is out and I brought you
some lunch myself,” she said simply.</p>

<p>“You are very good to me,” said Caleb.</p>

<p>She had turned away, and Sammy, who was devoted
to her, had again appropriated her hand. “You must
not stand,” she repeated, “I will never come here
again if you cannot obey the doctor’s orders.”</p>

<p>Caleb smiled. “I’d rather obey yours, Miss Royall,”
he said, his eyes following the two figures, the
woman and the child.</p>

<p>Half-way to the door Diana turned and let go the
child’s detaining fingers, coming toward him as if
with some new resolve. She had never looked more
lovely in his eyes, though to him she had always been
an exquisite picture. The warm flood of November
sunshine filling the room, and the deeper glow on the
hearth touched her and vivified the buoyancy and
freshness of her personality. Her chin was slightly
raised, and the delicate oval of her face glowed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
feeling; it seemed to him that her eyes were
wonderful.</p>

<p>“I want to ask your forgiveness,” she said.</p>

<p>“My forgiveness?” he was taken aback, “you
have done everything for me, been everything to me;
it is I who should ask forgiveness for having been a
burden here.”</p>

<p>She put aside his thanks with a gesture at once
gracious and significant, and the sweetness of her
smile arrested the words on his lips. “Nevertheless
I ask your pardon,” she said, “for—for my stupidity,
my ignorance, my want of manners long ago, when
you came here to the house and I treated you with
discourtesy. You were always fine; I was hateful.
You must have despised me!”</p>

<p>He smiled sadly. “I think you know that I did
not,” he said.</p>

<p>“I deserved it. But since then I have learned to
value your friendship, to honor you for the fight you
have made.”</p>

<p>He turned toward her; his tall gaunt figure seemed
to have lost some of its awkwardness, and the homely
sweetness of his haggard face had never been more
apparent. “You know,” he paused, and then went
on with deep emotion, “I recognized then, I do still,
the gap between our lives, but it cannot change the
one inevitable fact of my existence, my love for
you.”</p>

<p>The color rose from her chin to the arch of her
lovely brow, but her lips quivered. “You know that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
we have lost almost all we had, and—about my
mother?”</p>

<p>“I know,” he said simply, “Dr. Cheyney told me,
and”—he looked suddenly at Sammy and the dog—“your
goodness to these, when you must think—”</p>

<p>She looked up, and their eyes met. “Did you think
my heart was not big enough for all?” she asked.</p>

<p>Sudden joy leaped into his face, transfiguring it.
“Diana,” he exclaimed, “is it possible that through
it all, in spite of it all, you love me?”</p>

<p>She smiled. “I think I always loved you, Caleb,”
she said.</p>

<p>Mr. Oppenheim’s new story is a narrative of mystery
and international intrigue that carries the reader breathless
from page to page. It is the tale of the secret and
world-startling methods employed by the Emperor of
Japan through Prince Maiyo, his close kinsman, to ascertain
the real reasons for the around-the-world cruise of the
American fleet. The American Ambassador in London
and the Duke of Denvenham, an influential Englishman,
work hand in hand to circumvent the Oriental plot, which
proceeds mysteriously to the last page. From the time
when Mr. Hamilton Fynes steps from the <i>Lusitania</i> into a
special tug, in his mad rush towards London, to the very
end, the reader is carried from deep mystery to tense
situations, until finally the explanation is reached in a

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
